MOSCOW, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Moscow will press ahead with a major Russia-to-Germany natural gas pipeline, disregarding U.S. sanctions.

"Russia has implemented and will continue to implement its economic projects regardless of anyone's sanctions," the ministry said in the statement.

A U.S. bill signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday included legislation imposing sanctions on companies laying pipe for Nord Stream 2, which aims to double gas capacity along the northern Nord Stream 1 pipeline route to Germany. (Reporting by Andrey Kuzmin; Editing by Alexander Smith)
