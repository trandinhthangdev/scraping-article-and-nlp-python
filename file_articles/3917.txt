A powerful earthquake rocked Afghanistan and Pakistan today forcing terrified residents to evacuate buildings and flee into the streets.

The epicentre of the 6.1-magnitude tremor was around 30 miles southwest of Jarm in northern Afghanistan but could also be felt as far away as New Delhi in India and the Pakistan capital Islamabad.

Residents felt two short tremors in quick succession and fled buildings fearing a more powerful aftershock.

There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, the US Geological Survey said.

Panicked residents gathered in the streets and got out of their cars in several cities, including the Afghan capital Kabul and Lahore Peshawar in Pakistan.

The quake's epicentre was in a sparsely populated, remote mountain area in Badakhshan province and was recorded at a depth of around 125 miles.

In Islamabad, tremors shook furniture and power cable poles.

Resident Nusrat Jabeen said: "I was with my kids at a badminton court when we felt strong jolts.

"It was very scary. We felt everything was shaking. We ran out for safety."

The USGS estimated there would be few economic losses from the quake, with 'a low likelihood of casualties and damage.'

In September, a 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck roughly 22km north of Jhelum in Punjab province, at a particularly shallow depth of 10km. The worst hit region was Pakistan-administered Kashmir, with subsequent reports confirming 38 people had been killed and 300 others injured.
