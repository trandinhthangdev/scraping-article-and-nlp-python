The Christmas party season is in full swing across Britain as 'Thirsty Thursday' went with a bang last night.

Tens of thousands of revellers swamped pubs and clubs in towns and cities across the country as they celebrated the end of the working year - and fired the starting pistol on the festive period.

As the wine, beer and spirits flowed partygoers, many in fancy dress, danced and drank the night away with friends and colleagues before spilling out into the streets of London, Birmingham and Leeds.

But a sizeable minority had one too many drinks with people seen vomiting, urinating in doorways, fighting each other or needing medical help after collapsing.

Today, the last Friday before Christmas, is dubbed 'Mad Friday' as workers across the country celebrate the start of the holiday season, often with heavy drinking. Others call it 'black eye Friday' because the excessive boozing can lead to punch-ups and arrests.

On Twitter, Birmingham City Police said multiple officers were injured on Thursday night, including one who was 'bitten to the face, one with a bitten finger and one with a dislocated shoulder.' All offenders have been arrested and police say assaults on police officers will not be tolerated.

Police and paramedics are set for another busy night tonight and have said they 'won't act as babysitters' for those who get too drunk.

Police Scotland posted on Twitter that December is the busiest month for their service centres and December 20 would be the busiest day of the year so far.

Health chiefs have also warned that drunken party-goers who vomit in ambulances could take emergency vehicles off the road - preventing paramedics from saving other lives.

Emergency services are urging people to drink responsibly and are asking people not leave them to 'pick up the pieces'.

Steve Powell, a fleet assistant based at Barry Ambulance Station in Wales, cleans and re-stocks ambulances.

He said: 'When there has been excessive alcohol intake, people vomit over the rear of the vehicle. That has a vast impact on the responsiveness of the vehicle, and I don't think they realise this.

'It's then off the road for something like an hour and a half, maybe even two hours, or sometimes we have to get another vehicle to replace it, which isn't always readily available.'

Volunteers funded by the police are even being drafted in to patrol nightclubs in an attempt to help 'vulnerable' revellers.

Teams of two will guard dance floors and drinking areas to combat 'predatory behaviour', sexual assaults and fights.

Known as Nightlife Crews, they will also tell bouncers if someone appears to have drunk too much and will help them find a taxi or locate their friends. The £30,000 scheme is being tested for 12 months in Essex and could be extended if successful. It could also be adopted by other forces.

Volunteers wear red jumpers or hoodies with the logo 'Here to help you' and will work between 10pm and 4am on Fridays and Saturdays in Colchester, Chelmsford, Basildon and Southend.

Funding is shared between Essex Police, the fire service, police and crime commissioner's office, the NHS and local businesses and charities.

The scheme was criticised online by one local who called it 'the reality of snowflakeism', but clubs were supportive. Dave Vickery, manager of Unit 7 in Basildon, said: 'The biggest feedback we get is that people want to feel safe and this definitely makes them feel safer.'

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Barber said: 'The Nightlife Crews are specially trained to spot the signs that someone may be vulnerable or that someone is showing signs of predatory behaviour.'
