A Queensland mayor has become the seventh council leader known to have been charged with a criminal offence since the state last held local government elections.

Moreton Bay Mayor Allan Sutherland, 63, has been stood down after being charged with two counts of misconduct in public office by the state's corruption watchdog.

Mr Sutherland was arrested on Wednesday and charged at Fortitude Valley Police Station.

He was allowed bail and would appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on February 5, the Crime and Corruption Commission said in a statement.

Since the 2016 polls former Ipswich mayors Paul Pisasale and Andrew Antoniolli, former Logan Mayor Luke Smith and former Fraser Coast Mayor Chris Loft have either faced or are facing criminal charges.

Two north Queensland mayors - Doomadgee Aboriginal Shire Council Mayor Eric Waldren and Hope Vale Aboriginal Shire Council Mayor Greg McLean - were suspended in 2018 pending the outcome of criminal allegations.

A number of councillors also face charges.

Moreton Bay Regional Council Deputy Mayor Mike Charlton will act as mayor for the council based just north of Brisbane as Mr Sutherland contests the charges.

The CCC has not publicly detailed the allegations against him.

The CCC in September said it was investigating allegations relating to the ownership of a block of land in Burpengary.

In August, Mr Sutherland told the Pine Rivers Press he planned to retire after more than two decades in local government at next year's election.

The CCC kicked off an investigation called Operation Belcarra which looked into complaints of possible local government corruption following in the March 2016 elections.
