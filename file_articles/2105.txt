Alpha Diallo racked up 14 points and 12 rebounds as Providence rolled past Texas 70-48 on Saturday afternoon in Providence, R.I., as part of the Big East/Big 12 Battle.

The Friars led by 19 points at the half and dominated the second half as well, using their defense to hold Texas to 28.6 percent shooting in the final 20 minutes. The Longhorns were just 3 of 21 from 3-point range and were outrebounded 52-39.

Texas went the final 6:13 without a field goal as the Friars poured it on late and had three turnovers in that span.

Luwane Pipkins added 13 points for Providence, while Nate Watson scored 10 points and Kalif Young pulled down 10 rebounds in the win. Diallo's double-double was his sixth of the season.

Providence (7-6) had 15 assists to just five for the Texas. The Friars shot 38.8 percent from the field while Texas shot 31.7.

Courtney Ramey led the Longhorns (9-2) with 12 points, with Matt Coleman II adding 11 (all in the first half) and Jericho Sims taking a game-high 13 rebounds for Texas.

Providence forged a 7-0 run late in the first half to build a 31-19 lead after a dunk by Watson with 3:29 left. The Longhorns missed five straight shots during that stretch.

The Friars led 43-28 at intermission behind Pipkins' 13 points and a 45.7 percent to 34.4 percent shooting edge from the floor. Providence had just four first-half turnovers, and its reserve players outscored Texas's bench 11-4.

Coleman paced the Longhorns with 11 points in the first half while Ramey added 10. The rest of the team combined for just seven points and Texas was only 1 of 12 from beyond the arc in the half.

The Friars put some distance between themselves and Texas with a 6-0 run early in the second half during which the Longhorns were 0 of 8 from the floor and went scoreless for more than four minutes. By that time, Providence led 49-31 and that was plenty to hold off poor-shooting Texas.
