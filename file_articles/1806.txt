They tied the knot on September 1 in Hawaii.

Miles, 32, dismissed the airport's VIP service and wheeled their bags to a rental car stand where they waited 20 minutes for their car to turn up.

Keleigh, 26, was dressed in black aside from her snowy white sneakers.

The pair began dating in 2013 after meeting at a Grammys after-party and became engaged in August 2017 while on safari in South Africa.

Miles described how he popped the question saying he led Keleigh to a tree with a rose and note tied to it.

He said it read: 'May 11th, 2013-August 20th, 2017'.

On one knee he explained that the 2013 date 'was the first day that I asked you to be my girlfriend, and today was the last day you woke up as my girlfriend.'

Keleigh said yes right away and thought the proposal was 'perfect.'

'I’ll never get the image out of my head of him down on one knee with a tear in his eye,' she said.

'He really thought about every detail and was so nervous!'
