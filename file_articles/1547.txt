South African pace legend Dale Steyn declared himself fit to make his BBL debut for the Melbourne Stars on Sunday, but was not allowed to play because he'd been omitted from the 13-man squad a day earlier.

It means the Star's marquee man will now feature in a maximum of just four BBL matches on his short-term deal.

Steyn arrived in Australia with a side strain and the Stars have taken a cautious approach with his return to action, also leaving him out of Friday's win over Brisbane Heat.

He warmed up with his new teammates at Ted Summerton Reserve in Moe on Sunday ahead of the meeting with Hobart Hurricanes and told Channel 7 afterwards that he felt fit enough to play.

However, competition rules dictated the 36-year-old quick wasn't allowed to come into the squad at such a late stage.

Steyn is now expected to make his debut in Friday's meeting with Adelaide Strikers on the Gold Coast.

"I was really keen to play today," Steyn said.

"I think the 24-hour rule kind of does you in a little bit.

"I wouldn't have minded waking up today, coming to the ground, having a little bowl and then giving the thumbs up, but you've got to announce it 24 hours (before the match).

"I've gone through my warm-ups and bowled and I'm fine, but it's obviously too late now, so (Friday) will be it for me."

The Stars' pace battery is also without fellow high-profile recruit Nathan Coulter-Nile for a second successive match because of an ankle injury.
