John McGinn is set to miss up to three months after suffering a fractured ankle in Aston Villa’s match against Southampton.

The midfielder did the damage after challenging Cedric Soares for possession in the first half.

McGinn’s absence is a huge blow to Villa, who will be in the bottom three at Christmas - three points adrift of safety - after their 3-1 home defeat by Saints on Saturday.

Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn will miss around three months with a fracture of his ankle

McGinn had recently been playing with a tear in his thigh muscle but this is considerably more serious.

Along with Jack Grealish and Tom Heaton, McGinn was considered key to Villa’s survival hopes.

They face the two sides below them in the table in their next matches: Norwich at Villa Park on Boxing Day, and Watford away two days later.

Villa have lost their last four games and are in danger of finding themselves with too much ground to make up if they cannot take positive results from those games.

McGinn has scored three times in the league this term and is his team’s most effective attacking force along with Grealish.
