Willian believes Chelsea have to keep fighting if they want to finish in the Champions League places after overcoming Spurs.

The Brazilian forward scored both of Chelsea's goals on Sunday as they ended a run of just one win in four Premier League games by downing one of their main challengers for a place in the top four.

And Willian hailed their mentality after overcoming their fierce rivals.

Willian fired Chelsea to a welcome win with two first-half goals in a 2-0 win at rivals Tottenham

He said: 'I thought we did a great job from the first few minutes.

'This kind of game is about mentality and how we fight for every ball and in every minute and in every situation we did everything to win this game.

'We controlled the game and that's why we won the game.'

The 31-year-old also called for Frank Lampard's side to show more consistency.

Asked whether they needed to carry the momentum forward he said: 'I think so. We have to carry on. We cannot go up and down anymore. We have games coming up.

'We have to win games to stay at the top. I think we can do it.'

Chelsea, who are now four points clear in fourth, have struggled at Stamford Bridge this season, losing two of their last three games there and picking up four more points on their travels than at home.

And Willian wants them to start enjoying some home comforts when they face Southampton on Boxing Day, warning: 'We have to do exactly the same job when we play away and we have to do it at home.

'We don't have another option, we have to win.'
