Tammy set up her camera in the bathroom, as she pouted and playfully pushed her hair from her face.

Sporting a racy ensemble, like the one in the video, is not something Tammy shies away from.

The Instagram sensation regularly uploaded videos and photos in barely-there bikinis and form-fitting numbers to show off her enviable frame.

Tammy chose to caption the clip with a vague quote: ''Irrational, or is it passion.'

While Tammy is living the single life following her October split from Canadian raper Jahkoy, it appears he is still keen on getting back together.

He left three love-heart emojis under the post, but Tammy chose not to respond.

Tammy even laughed at the idea of reuniting with ex Jahkoy when asked by Daily Mail Australia last week.
