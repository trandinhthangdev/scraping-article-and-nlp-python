NSW Police say a man is missing from the rural village of Bell after a huge bushfire tore through the Lithgow area destroying dozens of buildings.

The man in his 60 or 70s lives on a remote property in Bell and the area was engulfed in fire on Saturday, NSW Police Chief Inspector Chris Sammut said on Sunday.

Another elderly man who had been missing from neighbouring Dargan has been located "safe and sound", the Rural Fire Service tweeted on Sunday morning.

He was found at an evacuation centre in Lithgow which was threatened by the huge Gospers Mountain megafire over the weekend.

Chief Insp Sammut said the man who was still unaccounted for lived on one of the remotest properties in Bell.

"He may have self-evacuated or went to stay with friends and we want the public to let us know any information they have to assist us locate this missing person," he told AAP.

Chief Insp Sammut confirmed up to five properties were burned in Lithgow on Saturday while about 30 buildings were lost in Clarence and Dargan.

Those numbers include sheds and other structures.

About 350 residential homes in Lithgow remained without power on Sunday afternoon.

State Nationals MP Paul Toole says the fire that bore down on Lithgow "was certainly diabolical with embers flying everywhere causing spot fires".

"Shout out to our men and women working tirelessly looking after people's lives and properties," the member for Bathurst told AAP after a briefing at the local fire control centre.

Colleague Sam Farraway MLC was also updated on the situation on Sunday.

"This area came very close last night to catastrophe," he said.

"The result today is a testament to all our agencies coming together to support our mighty RFS.

"We are concerned about those missing person and properties list."
