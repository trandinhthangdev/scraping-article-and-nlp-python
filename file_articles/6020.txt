San Antonio officers were called to South Park mall at 9pm yesterday, where they found shell casing 'all over the place', reports WOAI.

Witness Bryan Reyna, who was inside the mall at the time, said: 'I just saw everyone screaming, yelling and crying. Everybody started running out of Chili's. They were just pushing everyone.'

People have been advised to stay away from the area while police carry out their investigation.

Describing where the shooting took place, San Antonio police chief William McManus told WOAI-TV: 'It was barely inside the mall.'

'There's a shallow breezeway on the far end of the entrance. It happened just inside that breezeway when the victims were just about to exit the mall.'
