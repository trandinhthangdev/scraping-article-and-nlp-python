The sacking of Alex Stajcic as Matildas coach wasn't driven by any personal bias, an independent review has concluded.

The FFA on Thursday released the report from the independent review of the management of national teams.

It used Stajcic's sacking in January as a case study in its analysis of the information being used in management recommendations to the governing body's board.

Stajcic's axing just months from this year's Women's World Cup came with claims he'd been undermined by those who would have preferred a female in charge of the Matildas.

The review, chaired by Diane Smith-Gander alongside former Australian netball captain Liz Ellis and Sydney Olympics supremo Rod McGeoch, said claims a "lesbian mafia" had instigated Stajcic's removal were unsubstantiated.

"The Panel was unable to uncover any evidence supporting the existence of any formal 'lesbian mafia' or that the decision to terminate the Matildas head coach contract was driven by personal bias against Mr Stajcic or in pursuit of other agendas," the report reads.

FFA chairman Chris Nikou said the report would be a "crucial pillar" on which the future success of national teams will be built.

The report does, however, make extensive recommendations around the theme of "athlete centricity" in national team management, particularly in women's football.

"The voice of the athlete must be central to any high-performance program. A sport that can sustain a rich dialogue with their elite and sub-elite athletes will be the better for it," the report read.

"Stakeholders are clamouring for attention and, in endeavouring to gain control of the key decisions that guide the game, have relegated the athletes to the role of bit players.

"This is a dangerous path for football in Australia and one which must be arrested as soon as possible."
