This luxurious dish needs little else with it.

Serves 4 as a main course

1.3kg (3lb) waxy potatoes, such as Maris Piper, peeled and thinly sliced

4tbsp olive oil

275ml carton of vegan single cream

2 large garlic cloves, crushed

Grated nutmeg, salt and black pepper

Method

Preheat the grill to high. Put the potatoes in a large, wide pan with a 1cm depth of water. Cover, bring to the boil and cook for 7-10 minutes, until easily pierced with a knife.

Drain, keeping the potatoes in the pan. Pour 2tbsp oil and the cream over them, scatter with the garlic and season well, moving the potatoes so they’re all coated.

Grease a baking dish with olive oil, then tip the potatoes in and arrange in overlapping layers.

Pour the remaining oil over. Grill for 15 minutes, until golden brown.
