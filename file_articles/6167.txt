Maurco Icardi claims he enters 'killer mode' in the penalty area as he eyes a permanent move to PSG.

The Argentine striker has scored 13 times in 17 games since moving to the Ligue 1 champions on loan from Inter Milan in the summer.

Five of his goals have come in the Champions League, and the 26-year-old has explained how he is so lethal in front of goal.

'Scoring comes natural to me,' he told the club's official website. 'I always try to be in the best position.

'As soon as I have the opportunity to score, I have to stay focused and go into killer mode.

'Today, I have scored almost 150 goals and they're almost similar, all of them. That's my character.'

Icardi reportedly wants to make the move permanent, with PSG having a pre-agreed option to buy the striker for £58million in January.

But Icardi's agent wife Wanda Nara is looking elsewhere for her husband's next move, as reported by Tuttosport last week.

Nara is hopeful that the striker could attract offers from Real Madrid and Juventus before they are forced to decide on PSG - with Juve known to be long-term admirers.

He scored 124 goals in 219 games for Inter, including a sensational 2017/18 season where he scored 29 goals in 34 Serie A games.
