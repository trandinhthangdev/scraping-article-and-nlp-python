Blair revealed last October she was diagnosed with the condition which affects the brain and spinal chord, but that hasn't slowed her down one bit.

She starred in the Netflix series Another Life, her first role since being diagnosed with MS, which premiered on the streaming service in July.

She also stars in two upcoming movies, A Dark Foe, and When We Collided, which don't have release dates at this time.
