Liverpool are anxiously awaiting a medical diagnosis on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after he sustained a problem to the same right leg which was affected by his ACL injury, 20 months ago.

Oxlade-Chamberlain was substituted after 75 minutes but returned to the pitch on crutches to celebrate the club's first Club World Cup win - sealed by Roberto Firmino in extra-time.

Manager Jurgen Klopp said that ruptured ligaments had not been ruled out after he was kicked following an aerial challenge with Flamengo's Everton Ribiero.

Klopp said: 'When he lands, he gets the kick and rolls over. He feels ok. We will see. Is the ligament stretched only or rupture, partly ruptured? We will see. That is a danger on contact sport. We will see.'

The 26-year-old instantly waved his arms for help after the injury and slammed the ground in frustration as medics entered the field.

After receiving treatment for two minutes, he tried to stand up but could not initially manage it. Eventually, he gingerly walked off the pitch.
