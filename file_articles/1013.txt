Two fans have been banned from Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia for one year after directing obscenities at Washington Wizards guard Isaiah Thomas, according to multiple reports.

Thomas was ejected from Saturday night's game between the Wizards and 76ers when he went into the stands during a timeout in the fourth quarter to confront the fans.

After the game, Thomas said a fan used an obscene gesture and shouted obscenities at him during the game.

ESPN reported that a 76ers spokesperson said the fans admitted to the inappropriate language and gestures, which violated arena policy. The NBA also instituted a zero-tolerance policy before the season aimed at cracking down on abusive fan behavior.

The fans were sitting in seats held by a season ticket holder. The season seats also have been revoked, the spokesperson said.
