A plane passenger has suffered a very bumpy landing after an overhead locker collapsed on top of them.

LATAM Airlines flight 8070 out of Sao Paulo had just touched down in Frankfurt on Saturday morning when the locker fell down.

Pictures show that a pair of storage lockers fell across two seats in the central of the plane in economy class.

A plane passenger suffered minor injuries when overhead storage lockers on an LATAM flight from Sao Paulo to Frankfurt collapsed as the plane was landing

Fortunately the lockers were not full when they fell, and one plane passenger suffered only minor injuries.

They were attended to by flight attendants, before disembarking the plane.

An LATAM spokesman: 'Fortunately, the passengers on board are doing well and have been landed normally and safely.

'LATAM regrets this and stresses that it provided all necessary assistance to passengers.

'The aircraft that performed the flight underwent corrective maintenance to operate the next scheduled flights.

'Finally, LATAM reiterates that this is a one-off incident and does not match the standard of the company’s aircraft.'

Data from flight tracking service FlightAware24 shows that the plane, an Airbus A350, landed 35 minutes ahead of schedule.

A flight the following day from Frankfurt to Sao Paulo was delayed taking off by almost 40 minutes, though a spokesman denied the locker was the cause.
