Extra firefighting resources are being sent to South Australia's Kangaroo Island as efforts continue to fully contain a blaze still burning.

The Country Fire Service says the fire at Duncan has been slowed but is moving on three fronts.

"Plans are currently being developed to secure the fire edge over the coming week," the CFS said.

"This will include numerous firefighters and appliances travelling to the island from the mainland to assist the local crews."

On Monday crews will work to burn off pockets of vegetation within the fire ground and will also conduct a backburning operation on the eastern side.

So far, one home has been confirmed destroyed on the Island but damage assessment is still underway.

More than 10,000 hectares of scrub has been burnt.

A number of fires were sparked amid catastrophic conditions on Friday, most thought the result of lightning strikes.
