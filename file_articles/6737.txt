Edwina Bartholomew and her husband Neil Varcoe have received an early Christmas present, with the Sunrise presenter giving birth to a baby girl.

A Seven Network spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the couple welcomed their bundle of joy into the world on Wednesday evening.

The 36-year-old was last seen running errands in Sydney with Neil on Saturday, showing off her large baby bump in a leopard print shirt.

A Seven spokesperson confirmed to Yahoo Lifestyle that the journalist and her husband Neil named the baby girl, Molly.

Last week, Edwina shared a selfie of her bump, revealing she was overdue.

'9 months and 3 days [pregnant] and moving house,' she joked, while unpacking boxes with husband Neil rather than resting up.

The couple have been racing against time in recent months to finish renovating their $1.6 million heritage home in Sydney's inner-west before the arrival of their little one.

'If the baby comes early, we will not be ready,' the pregnant star joked to The Daily Telegraph in October while discussing the 1870s inner-west terrace.

Edwina continued: 'We are having a baby in two months and still have no doors or windows. The house is actually a heritage item and bricks are protected.'

The Channel Seven journalist announced her pregnancy news earlier in the year.

'We're having a baby, due in December,' she told her colleagues on Channel Seven's breakfast show on June 5.

Edwina added: 'We're super stoked and our family is really excited. Mum has been bursting at the seams to tell everyone - so mum, you can tell everyone!'

She explained that Sunrise co-host Samantha Armytage already knew about the pregnancy, and fellow reporter Natalie Barr had guessed it due to her odd cravings.

The mother-to-be also shared a sonogram photo with Sunrise viewers, adding that she is yet to find out if she's having a boy or a girl.

Edwina married Neil, a digital media executive, on April 21, 2018 at their restored farmhouse in Lithgow, New South Wales.
