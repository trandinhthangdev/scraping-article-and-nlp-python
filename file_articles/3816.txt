Frank Warren has blasted Anthony Joshua's offer to spar fellow British heavyweight Tyson Fury as 'all nonsense'.

Joshua reclaimed his unified belts by beating Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia this month and recently publicly offered to spar Fury ahead of his expected rematch with Deontay Wilder.

But Fury's promoter has since emphatically rubbished Joshua's offer, claiming the Brit is already backing out.

Promoter Frank Warren has blasted Joshua's offer to spar Fury, claiming it's 'all nonsense'

Warren told The Metro: 'That's all nonsense. Joshua is already backing out of the offer.

'He's said he can't believe he said it and we've all had those moments. Who cares about them sparring each other? We want to see them fight.

'This sparring session will never happen. What's the point of it? It's about them in the ring together being watched by paying punters, not in the gym.'
