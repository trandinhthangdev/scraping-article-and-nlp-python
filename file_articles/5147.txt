LSU was named Thursday the winner of the Joe Moore Award, signifying the most outstanding offensive line in college football.

The Foundation for Teamwork, which has presented the award annually since 2015, made an unexpected visit to Baton Rouge, La., to notify the No. 1 Tigers of the award.

"Thank you @JoeMooreAward for this incredible honor," offensive line coach James Cregg wrote on Twitter. "These men have put in countless hours of work on and off the field. Couldn't be prouder of a group of men!!!"

Quarterback Joe Burrow thanked his offensive line to start his Heisman Trophy acceptance speech on Saturday.

"I think the first thing I want to say is, I want to thank my O-line first," he said. ."..Those guys have been unbelievable this year and I couldn't have done it without them."

Behind the offensive line, LSU set a number of school offensive single-season records, including points (621), scoring average (47.8), games with 40 or more points (10) and 50-point games (six).

The award is judged on six criteria -- toughness, effort, teamwork, consistency, technique and finishing -- and voted on by a group that includes FBS offensive line coaches, former players and some media members.

Other finalists for the award were Alabama, Ohio State and Oregon.

No. 1 LSU will meet No. 4 Oklahoma in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 28 in one College Football Playoff semifinal game.
