Real Madrid 'sent two senior scouts to watch Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga' in Wednesday night's League Cup match against Amiens.

The 17-year-old midfielder has been attracting interest from a number of leading European clubs after impressing in the French top-flight.

And, according to Spanish newspaper Diario AS, Real are the latest to take a closer look at Camavinga after Barcelona and Atletico Madrid did so.

However, French newspaper L'Equipe say that Camavinga, who has been valued at €60million (£51.2m) by Rennes, has no intention of moving away at such a young age.

He has been a Rennes player since the age of 11 and became their youngest-ever professional when he signed his contract in December 2018 aged 16 and one month.

And he made his professional debut for the club in a league fixture against Angers in April 2019.

He has started 15 league matches for Rennes this season and enjoyed a first taste of the UEFA Europa League.

Rennes were beaten 3-2 by Amiens in the game on Wednesday night.
