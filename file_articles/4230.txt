A Bondi dog owner has been left furious after a council ranger took pictures of him illegally walking his dog off the leash and then texted him saying he would be fined.

The resident, who asked not to be named, took his staffy Frankie to a grassed area in Sydney's South Bondi, where dogs must be leashed, at 6.30am one morning this month.

He was told he would be given a $330 fine for letting his dog loose but was able to talk his way out of it because there was no-one else around.

'I was just giving Frankie some exercise with the ball, I put her on a leash if people are around, he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I've taken her to the same spot for two years and never had a problem.'

The ranger provided a photo to Frankie's owner showing the staffy walking without a leash

Frankie's owner received a text message from the ranger, whom he didn't know had his number, saying he'd been seen walking his dog without a lead again

But then the ranger scanned the dog's microchip, which contains the owner's address, phone numbers and email.

Days later the owner received a text message from the ranger, whom he didn't know had his number, saying he'd been seen walking his dog without a lead again.

'Just letting you know that I have observed you walking your dog 'Frankie' unleashed on Campbell pde today. Fine will be issued this time,' it read.

The owner replied insisting that his dog was on the lead the whole time - but the ranger responded by sending him damning evidence.

He attached a photo showing the owner with his dog about 50m from his house.

The ranger also said he saw the man with the dog off the lead at The Depot a café.

Waverley Council said it needed more time to look into the matter before commenting.

The council has strict rules on dogs and only allows them to be let off the leash in certain parks.
