Anna opted to shun the cardinal legs-or-cleavage rule in favour of full on sex appeal in the slinky number, which showed off her hourglass figure.

She added a boost to her height with perspex heels and toted a black Louis Vuitton bag on her shoulder.

The reality star wore her raven hair in a slicked back ponytail and accentuated her bronzed tan with a glamorous make-up look.

The girls appeared in high spirits as they tottered into the club arm-in-arm.

The outing comes after Anna's recent holiday in Dubai, where she hit out at body shamers with a slew of sizzling bikini selfies.

The ex pharmacist was the picture of confidence as she slipped into a slinky black bikini during her sun-soaked trip.

In her typically bold fashion, the reality star responded to backlash from cruel trolls by penning on her widely-followed social media account: 'All the fat shamers can kiss myyy FAT a** stretch marks and all.'

The media personality showcased her sensational curves in the scanty two-piece, which featured a classic bralet and a tiny thong.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Anna talked about her incredible figure. She said: 'I don’t have a vigorous work out regime at all – I need to be stricter really for health reasons.

'I didn’t work out at all before going on the show. While I was in Majorca during lockdown was the only time I really thought "maybe I should be a bit healthier."

'I would have thought that coming out and having cameras in my face would make me want to work out but it hasn’t. I’ve been the opposite actually.'

She added: 'I still get trolled but I am getting stronger. I filter out bad comments.

'If I get a DM I read the first few words and if I can tell it’s going to be negative I just block and delete straight away. That’s my way forward.'
