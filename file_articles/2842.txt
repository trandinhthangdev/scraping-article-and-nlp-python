The Celtics used an 11-0 run to grab their first double-digit lead, 41-31, with 8:14 remaining in the second quarter. The Pistons got as close as six, but Boston responded with Brown hitting a pair of 3-pointers around a steal in an 11-second span for a 56-42 edge.

Brown was at it again with 1.1 seconds left, completing a four-point play to give the Celtics a 60-48 lead at the break.
