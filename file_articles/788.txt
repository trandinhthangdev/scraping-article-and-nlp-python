Bosses’ confidence in the outlook for Britain’s economy over the next year jumped sharply after the election, a survey reveals.

The Institute of Directors confidence tracker, which records whether firms feel optimistic or pessimistic, rose to a score of 21 per cent in November as positive views outweighed negative ones – the highest score since the EU referendum in June 2016.

In October, it registered a score of minus 18 per cent.

A firm majority Government means business leaders, whatever their personal views, now have a framework around which they can put in place plans to invest, hire and expand.’

To get the figures, the institute questioned 952 decision-makers at a range of firms between December 13 and 20.
