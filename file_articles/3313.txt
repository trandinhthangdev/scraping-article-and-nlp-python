The MRI exam performed on Gordon Hayward's left foot displayed no structural damage, Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens told reporters on Friday.

Hayward apparently has been bothered by pain in the foot since early November. He will sit out Friday night's game against the Detroit Pistons after also missing Wednesday's contest against the Dallas Mavericks.

Hayward underwent the MRI exam on Thursday as the team sought answers for why he was dealing with pain.

"Just same pain that hopefully will dissipate in the next couple of days," Stevens told reporters. "It's nothing muscular, it's nothing bone-wise."

Hayward broke his left ankle five minutes into the 2017-18 season, and the horrific injury cost him the entire season.

Hayward is averaging 17.5 points, 6.1 rebounds and 4.1 assists in 11 games this season. He missed time with a hand injury earlier this season.

Also, point guard Marcus Smart will miss his fifth straight game due to an eye infection.

"The last report I got, they didn't think they've seen one this bad," Stevens told reporters, referring to the training staff. "He's just really had a tough go about it. So, I don't know when he'll be back. He's still not around here."

Smart is averaging 11.8 points and 4.6 assists in 20 games (15 starts).
