SINGAPORE/MOSCOW, Dec 23 (Reuters) - PetroChina's subsidiary refinery, Dalian Petrochemical Corp, plans to have a major turnaround in April-May of 2020, four industry sources told Reuters.

The maintenance is scheduled to start from late March or early April and last for around one and a half months, the sources said.

The 410,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) Dalian plant, located in the northeast Chinese port city of Dalian and which is PetroChina's largest refinery, is linked to Russia's East Siberia Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline.
