Hertha Berlin manager Jurgen Klinsmann 'is considering signing Victor Wanyama from his old club Tottenham Hotspur'.

Klinsmann, who played for Spurs in two spells during his playing days, took over as Hertha manager on November 27 and is keen to strengthen his squad in January.

And, according to the Daily Telegraph, Wanyama is a potential reinforcement in midfield after falling out of favour at White Hart Lane.

Hertha manager Jurgen Klinsmann needs reinforcements and could swoop on his former club

The Kenya international, 28, has made just four appearances for Spurs this season and his late substitute appearance in last week's defeat to Bayern Munich was his first outing since late September.

Klinsmann could also offer Arsenal's Granit Xhaka an escape route following a turbulent first half of the season.

The Switzerland international was stripped of the Arsenal captaincy by now departed manager Unai Emery last month following an angry reaction towards fans who were jeering him during a game with Crystal Palace in October.

Xhaka knows the Bundesliga well having signed for Arsenal from Borussia Monchengladbach for £35million back in 2016. Klinsmann has taken charge of four Hertha matches so far, winning two, drawing one and losing one.

They sit 13th in the Bundesliga table.
