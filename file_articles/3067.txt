Anna Kendrick was hard at work on her new show Love Life on Friday in NYC.

The Pitch Perfect actress wasn't afraid to do some heavy lifting as she made her way across the Big Apple's Tompkins Square Park with a sizable roll-up mattress during the shoot.

Anna, 34, was bundled up for the scene where she was clad in a puffy jacket, black jeans and a dark tee shirt.
