Patrick Vieira has revealed Arsenal did not approach him before hiring Mikel Arteta as their new manager.

The north London club appointed the Manchester City assistant on Friday following an exhaustive search for Unai Emery's replacement.

Asked whether he had been contacted by his former club, Nice boss Vieira said: 'No. It's flattering seeing your name everywhere but I am under contract with Nice.

'I have known since I arrived how lucky I am to be involved with this club's project. I don't have any intention or desire to go and look elsewhere.'

Arteta watched from the stands as Arsenal drew 0-0 with Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday.

The session seemed to mainly involve players who didn't feature in Arsenal's draw with Everton.

The former Gunners midfielder was animated as he delivered his first session to the players after signing a three-and-a-half year contract at the Emirates.

Star players Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Pepe, Matteo Guendouzi and Mesut Ozil were all involved in training and could be recalled to the starting XI at the Vitality Stadium.
