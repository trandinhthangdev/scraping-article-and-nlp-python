Michael Zerafa's camp has decided to lodge a protest following his controversial boxing loss to Jeff Horn in Brisbane.

Zerafa dropped a majority points decision in their brutal and bloody middleweight rematch on Wednesday night.

The Victorian and his team felt referee John Cauci should have stopped the bout in the ninth round to spare Horn further punishment.

They also thought the referee's decision to briefly halt the contest to have Horn's cut examined by the doctor was unwarranted intervention which influenced the outcome.

After consultation with their lawyer, Zerafa's campaign Friday confirmed they would protest the result.

"As a team we've sat down watched and re-watched the fight and we have some concerns about a number of things that happened during the fight that shouldn't have," said Zerafa's co-manager Brendan Bourke.

"If the calls to my phone since the fight are anything to go by, these concerns aren't limited to me or the team.

"Many people in the boxing community have contacted me and have raised the same issues.

"I don't propose to go into detail at this stage. We have more than a week before we lodge the protest and we want this to be dealt with properly and we want it dealt with it respectfully to both Michael and Jeff."

Horn's victory avenged his stoppage loss to Zerafa in Bendigo in August.
