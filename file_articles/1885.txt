ST. PETERSBURGH, Fla. (AP) - Marcus Weathers scored 14 of his career-high 22 points in the second half and Duke improved to 10-0 with an 86-77 win over Austin Peay on Saturday in the St. Pete Shootout.

Sincere Carry added 16 points for the Dukes, who are off to the best start since the 1953-54 team went 22-0. That team reached No. 1 in February of 1954 and featured Sid Dambrot, father of current head coach Keith Dambrot, as a guard.

Tavian Dunn-Martin scored 13 points, Maceo Austin had 12 and Baylee Steele 11 of the bench for the Dukes, who shot 51% and made 30 of 24 from the foul line.

Jordyn Adams led Austin Peay with 23 points and Terry Taylor had 16 points and 11 rebounds.

Carry scored 14 points in the first half to help Duquesne open a 45-36 lead and then the Dukes got a three-point play from Weathers and a 3-pointer from Austin to make it 51-36 barely a minute into the second half.

An 8-0 run, with five points from Adams, cut the lead to six. Late in the second half, Duquesne missed seven straight shots and the Governors made seven to close the gap to 63-58 with seven minutes left. Weathers scored consecutive baskets to stop the rally but Austin Peay kept battling back before Duquense would come up with a big play. Austin made four free throws in the final minute to ice the win and remain one of four undefeated Division I teams.
