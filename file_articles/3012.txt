The TCU athletic program was placed on probation for one year by the NCAA after a self-reported violation revealed work-compensation irregularities among athletes from multiple sports, ESPN reported.

The report said a total of 33 football and women's basketball players received excessive pay for an on-campus job with the maintenance department.

The error occurred when student-athletes failed to clock out of work, triggering overpayments that were estimated to be a collective $20,000 over a four-year period from 2015 to 2018.

"I'm proud of TCU's culture of compliance that led to these issues being identified, promptly disclosed, and corrected," TCU chancellor Victor J. Boschini Jr. said in a statement. "I also am thankful for our team who successfully collaborated to ensure that we not only resolved this issue but continue to send a message of strong ethical leadership at TCU."

The NCAA's probation period will extend to Dec. 19, 2020. The Horned Frogs athletic department was also fined $47,148, which includes 10 percent of the revenue it received from participating in the first round of the 2018 NCAA Tournament.
