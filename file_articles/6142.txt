Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed Manchester United are interested in signing Red Bull Salzburg striker Erling Haaland.

Haaland has been heavily linked with a number of European clubs in recent weeks, after an eye-catching start to the season in which he has scored 28 goals in 22 appearances in all competitions.

The 19-year-old is one of the most in-demand players across the continent, and United seem to be leading the way for his signature - with the Manchester United manager now admitting he has had a 'good development'.

'He is a player I like. We are looking for good players all the time,' Solskjaer told Viasport.

'Erling has had a good development, so he has to develop further wherever he decides.

'I don't need to talk so much about him, but we as a team always look for players who can complement the others we have, and then we see what we end up with.'
