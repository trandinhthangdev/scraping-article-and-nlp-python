They're good friends in real life, but have been dragging out a fictitious feud in the media for several years.

And on Friday in New York, Hugh Jackman got coerced by Ryan Reynolds into wearing an ugly Christmas sweater and matching underwear.

Fans of the A-list stars would remember in December last year, when Ryan, 43, was tricked into wearing the sweater by Hugh, 51, and mutual friend Jake Gyllenhaal.

Taking to Instagram, Hugh shared a photo of himself in the green, red and gold sweater, standing in front of a white Christmas tree inside his New York home.

The Wolverine actor wrapped one arm around a casually dressed Ryan and beamed for the camera.

Hugh wrote in the post's caption: 'I can't believe I agreed to wear the matching underwear too,' alongside the hashtag 'the sweater returns'.

However the feud is in good nature, with Ryan having teamed up with charity, Sick Kids Foundation.

Ryan will match any donations made before Christmas, when the sweater is worn.

The sweater saga began in December last year, when the husband of actress Blake Lively, revealed he had been tricked into thinking a party had an ugly sweater theme.

Taking to Instagram at the time, Ryan shared a photo of himself in the same green, red and gold ribbon top, in front of the same white Christmas tree.

The picture which saw him joined by Hugh and Jake, 39, was captioned: 'These f***ing a**holes said it was a sweater party.'

The sweater shenanigans comes after Hugh trolled Ryan last month, while congratulating John Legend on becoming People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive.

Hugh raved on Instagram about how he had won the title himself back in 2008, despite the fact Ryan had also won in 2010.

Their hilarious rivalry began around the time Ryan starred in 2016 Marvel film, Deadpool.

Hugh and Ryan previously starred together in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine.
