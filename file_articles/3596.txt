Duncan Ferguson will urge incoming manager Carlo Ancelotti to take note of the Everton DNA he has put down during his two weeks in temporary charge.

The club's caretaker boss also said he would love to remain part of the coaching team under the Italian, who is expected to take formal charge on Monday.

Ferguson, 47, a fans' favourite during his playing days, pledged to tell Ancelotti exactly what makes Everton tick.

It has been there for all to see in the 3-1 win against Chelsea and a 1-1 draw at Manchester United in the Premier League and coming from two goals down in the Carabao Cup against Leicester, before losing on penalties.

Ahead of Saturday's home clash with Arsenal, Ferguson said: 'Everyone has different ways they approach the game but the way we've approached it has proven to be the right way. And the Everton fans do get behind that style of football.

'You need tactics and a gameplan and we've instilled that in the players. But, of course, you need to run around, make tackles, win headers and do the fundamentals, or you won't get anything.'
