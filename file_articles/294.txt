She's the fitness mogul and Instagram model known for her gym-honed figure and picture perfect selfies.

But on Monday, Tammy Hembrow proved she doesn't need to be in skimpy activewear to get attention on social media.

The 25-year-old Gold Coast-based stunner took to her Instagram to share a series of playful selfies as she sat in the front of her car, after running errands.

Tammy wore a matching white hoodie over her shoulders, and completed the look with matching trousers.

In one of the snaps, the doting mother-of-two is seen flirting with the camera as she bites her pointing finger.

In the other, Tammy is seen leaning in while her blonde locks fall over her face.

It appears as if the Instagram sensation spent the day buying Christmas supplies, with the back seat crammed with wrapping paper and plastic bags.

The sighting comes after Tammy took to her Instagram to reveal the secrets to her incredible physique, as she completed a gruelling ab workout over the weekend.

The Instagram model recently revealed she maintains her enviable frame by 'doing a lot of heavy weights'.

During an appearance on Studio 10 on Tuesday last week, she explained: 'You're not going to build any muscle if you are not doing leg weights.'

'I see a lot of girls doing cardio and this and that, it is not going to build any muscle really,' she added.
