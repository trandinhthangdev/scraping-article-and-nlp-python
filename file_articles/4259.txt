This is the adorable moment a dog wiggles his ears in time to a Christmas carol.

The cute hound called Fatty Fluffball seems to be in the festive spirit as he moves his ears in time to 'Deck The Halls.'

Fluffball is a six-year old German Spitz and his owner, actress Lara Heller who is in her 20s, says he immediately perks up and joins in when he hears music.

Footage shows the pooch as his ears twitch up and down in time to the song and he looks around in excitement.

Lara, from Brighton, says she has created a trick to encourage Fluffball to waggle his ears in time but is coy about exactly how she did it.

She said: 'He just loves music. He's a clown bless him and his best friend is a three-legged cat.

'I was just horsing around with him at the time we had the Christmas carol on. He is always so funny and wags his ears.'

Fluffball also has an issue with teeth alignment which means he often sticks his tongue out for longer periods than a dog normally would.

Lara also goes paddle boarding with Fluffball in the sea off the Sussex coast, and her talented pooch is becoming a big hit on his FattyFluffball instagram account.

The carol Fluffball is miming to is 'Deck The Halls,' originally sung by Nat King Cole.
