The European champions are ready to let highly-rated teenage striker Brewster leave Anfield temporarily in January in order to play regular football.

Championship rivals Preston, Huddersfield, Sheffield Wednesday, Charlton and QPR are also keen to take the 19 year-old for the rest of the season.

But Swansea hope their offer of guaranteed game time and Steve Cooper's presence as manager at the Liberty Stadium will work in their favour.

Brewster was an unused substitute in Liverpool's Champions League semi-final second leg against Barcelona and final win against Spurs last season and also part of the squad for their pre-season tour of America.

But he is desperate to get some regular senior football under his belt having been limited to just two first team appearances this season, Carabao Cup starts against MK Dons and Arsenal.

Meanwhile, former Liverpool academy manager Cooper was in charge of the England under-17 side that Brewster was part of and won the World Cup In 2017.

Brewster thrived under Cooper, finishing the tournament as top scorer with eight goals, and is now being lined up for a reunion with his former boss.
