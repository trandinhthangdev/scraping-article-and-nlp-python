Western Australia's firefighting aerial fleet has dropped 8.9 million litres of water so far this bushfire season, which is more than half the water used for the entirety of 2018-19.

The recent Yanchep bushfire alone accounted for about 4.7 million litres of water, Emergency Services minister Francis Logan said.

It is also the driest start to the southern season in more than 40 years.

The Georgia Peach aircrane, which has been fighting fires in Greece, arrived in Perth on Monday.

WA's aerial fleet now consists of 33 rotary and fixed-wing suppression and aerial intelligence aircraft.
