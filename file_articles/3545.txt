A popular chocolate factory in the Adelaide Hills has been spared major damage from a bushfire burning out of control.

Melba's Chocolates at Woodside came under threat on Friday from the blaze, which quickly burnt through more than 10,000 hectares of mostly scrub.

Managing director Tom Foristal said the factory was saved thanks to the efforts of firefighters.

"Our sincerest thanks and gratitude goes out to those who helped save our building and those of others," he said.

"Our thoughts go out to those who were not so lucky."

An unconfirmed number of homes and other buildings at Woodside have been destroyed or damaged.

Other properties were also damaged at nearby Lobethal.

The Adelaide Hills fire was likely to burn for several days after staring amid catastrophic conditions.

Milder weather across the fire ground on Saturday was expected to aid the hundreds of firefighters still battling the blaze.
