She appeared on Saturday Night Live for the first time this weekend.

And Lizzo posted an inspirational before and after tweet after her performance.

One image showed the 31-year-old as the Statue Of Liberty in a sparkly blue robe while in the other she plays Lady Liberty in a black dress with a plunging neckline.

She captioned it: 'On the left was when I worked for liberty taxes, as a sign spinner... on the right is my @nbcsnl debut.

'Don’t stop...we need you. Your time is coming,' the 31-year-old joked.

Lizzo, who real name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson, is an American singer-songwriter, rapper and flutist.

She wore a relatively demure black satin suit when she appeared on stage singing her hits Truth Hurts and Good As Hell.

And she changed into a strapless green satin minidress for the SNL afterparty in NYC on Saturday.

Her long brunette tresses were styled in tight waves. And she showed off her red pedicure in a pair of high heels decorated with white ostrich feathers.

The show marked the final episode of Saturday Night Live for this year and decade.

It also welcomed back Eddie Murphy, one of its most beloved alumni.

The comedian, 58, was a regular cast member on Saturday Night Live from 1980 until 1984.

He was in rare form on Saturday's show, most notably when he crashed the Weekend Update segment as the loudmouthed, brash Gumby and all but refused to leave.
