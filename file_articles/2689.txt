Major champion Adam Scott put himself in a strong position to claim his second Australian PGA Championship crown after opening up a one-shot lead courtesy of a battling 69 on Saturday.

The 2013 winner closed his third round with birdies at the 16th and 18th to move to 10 under par, leaving him one stroke clear of fellow Australian Wade Ormsby following his bogey-free 70.

Former Masters champion Scott had started the day two shots behind halfway leader Carl Yuan and slipped even further back when he dropped a shot at the fifth.
