South Australian Premier Steven Marshall has decided not to leave on a planned overseas holiday as major bushfires continue to burn across the state.

Mr Marshall said he would remain in Adelaide while the State Emergency Centre, which was established to coordinate efforts to fight the fires, remained active.

"My focus at the moment is not on my Christmas holidays," he said.

"It's trying to make sure we get through this difficult period."

The premier had been scheduled to leave this week for a holiday in New Zealand.

Instead, he provided updates on the bushfires on Saturday after briefings from emergency service chiefs.

The premier confirmed 15 homes had been destroyed in the SA fires which were sparked in catastrophic conditions on Friday.

Two people were killed, one at Charleston, in the Adelaide Hills, and one near Lameroo in the southeast of the state.

The fire in the hills and one on Kangaroo Island continue to burn out of control with watch and act messages in place.

Both fires were expected to burn for several days.
