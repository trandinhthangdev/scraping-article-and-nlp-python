Roy Hodgson says he is facing the worst injury crisis of his Crystal Palace tenure after Scott Dann became the latest defender to pick up a problem on Friday.

Dann injured a calf in training and joins a growing list of absentees and doubts for Saturday's match at Newcastle.

Mamadou Sakho is banned, while fellow defender Joel Ward (knee) and Jeffrey Schlupp (thigh) are out injured.

Jairo Riedewald suffered a hip injury as a makeshift left back against Brighton on Monday.

At least Patrick van Aanholt is training again and could play his first game for three weeks.

Asked if he had ever faced a bigger injury crisis, Hodgson, 72, said: 'Certainly it is the worst since I have been here.'
