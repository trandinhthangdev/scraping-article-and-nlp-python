Former Wimbledon junior champion Laura Robson has undergone a second hip operation of 2019 to try and save her career.

The 25-year-old left-handed Brit, who made the world's top 30 as a teenager, revealed she has had more surgery, having not been able to play since April.

As with fellow hip sufferer Andy Murray, months of rehab work has not proved successful.

While she did not go into details of the procedure it will not have been the same as the metal cap operation the Scot has successfully been through, as that is not suitable for women.

Robson, whose elite career was first stunted by major wrist problems, said she was hoping to 'Try and fix the pain for good.'

She added via her Instagram account that she 'Very much hopes to be back on court soon' although in the best case scenario that would not be until well into 2020.

She also posted footage of herself on crutches trying to walk again following the surgery.

Robson first went under the knife in June 2018 and returned to action in February but has not played since retiring during a match in Sunderland in April.
