Car buyers are being offered bigger savings on the price of a new motor if they finance it rather than buy it outright in a bid to corral them into becoming repeat customers.

A review of manufacturer's dealers found that the price of a new model would be slashed on average by 11.6 per cent, or £4,102, if a driver took out a finance package.

That compares to an average saving of 8 per cent - or £2,881 - if motorists opt to buy a vehicle outright with cash.

What Car? said the heavy emphasis on finance discounts reflected the high demand for PCP and hire purchase deals available, with finance accounting for 70 per cent of all new car sales in the UK.

Such levels of competition means franchised car dealers are willingly chopping huge chunks away from the price of their models to tempt customers into deals.

However, dealerships will benefit from providing finance over cash purchases, as they can get repeat custom and rake in money from servicing and maintenance.

Buyers who prefer to own outright can beat the system by taking out finance deals for their bigger discounts and then clearing them early.

By encouraging people to take out finance deals - namely Personal Contract Purchases - salesmen have a higher chance of the customer returning at the end of the agreement when the car can be bought or replaced with another model on a fresh finance package.

Finance deals also allow salesmen to increase interest rates so they can pocket more commission, an investigation uncovered earlier this year.

Of the brands offering the best savings on new vehicle finance, Nissan topped the list.

Top 10 car brands for finance discounts 1. Nissan: 14.04% saving or £3,346 2. Skoda: 13.73% saving or £3,675 3. Seat: 13.70% saving or £3,370 4. Hyundai: 13.54% saving or £3,153 5.

Mystery shoppers on behalf of What Car? found that the average saving on the retail price of a new Nissan was 11 per cent, which worked out at £3,718 off the Japanese manufacturer's latest models.

If you look at PCP deals alone - which have the highest likelihood of customers returning to the dealer in two to four year's time - Nissan salesmen were found to be trimming an average of 14 per cent - or £3,346 - in 2019.

Value brand Dacia was found to pass the lowest savings to buyers, discounting its new models by just 2.4 per cent, or £282 since January.

'Finance discounts outweighed cash offers significantly this year, however, proving that cash isn't always king when negotiating a deal to buy a new car,' What Car? said.

According to it's own Target Price service, 17 brands in the UK have offered finance buyers more than a 10 per cent saving on the list price of a car since January, while just four brands offered savings of 10 per cent or more to cash buyers.

The research comes at a time of declining new car sales. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), new car sales were down 2.7 per cent year-to-date in November 2019.

The discounts have offset a slight increase in prices, with UK inflation at 1.5 per cent in October 2019, while interest rates have remained at 0.75 per cent since August 2018.

Steve Huntingford, Editor of What Car?, said: 'Manufacturers are clearly competing hard in a tough market, with 17 brands offering average discounts of more than 10 per cent when buying on finance.

The 10 brands with smallest car finance discounts 1. Dacia: 2.38% saving or £282 2. Land Rover: 4.77% saving or £2,664 3. Ssangyong: 4.88% saving or £1,109 4. Toyota: 5.26% saving or £1,363 5. DS: 5.56% saving or £1,484 6. MG: 5.98% saving or £899 7. Subaru: 6.52% saving or £1,846 8. Lexus: 7.55% saving or £3,248 9. Infiniti: 7.68% saving or £2,263 10.

'When just four brands do so for cash buyers, it's clear to see just how important finance is for Britain's new car sales and the impact a good finance discount can have in persuading consumers.'

Earlier this year it was confirmed that as many as 500,000 car buyers have been ripped off by ruthless dealers who increase interest rates to ratchet up the cost of a finance deal.

As this raises the overall price of the deal, the dealers are paid more in commission.

The devious tactics, uncovered during a two-year investigation by the Financial Conduct Agency (FCA) - the Government's finance watchdog, allow dealers to overcharge customers by an astonishing total of around £165million year, and many find themselves locked in a spiral of debt.
