Q: I’m 67 and take pride in my appearance — but I’ve forgotten about my hands and they look so old! Is there anything that could help?

A: If you’ve neglected your hands (like most of us), getting a dramatic improvement requires serious (and expensive!) treatment, like a series of chemical peels.

These needn’t be as scary as they sound. The PRX-T33 peel is a blend of medical-grade cell-regenerating and de-pigmenting acids that do their work under the skin surface, so you get no weeping, peeling downtime.

An anonymous reader asked British beauty expert Inge van Lotringen, for advice on improving the appearance of aging hands (file image)

It’s massaged, in layers, into the skin, and neutralised with water after five minutes. The backs of your hands will look plumper immediately, while crepeyness, lines and age spots are significantly reduced after three to five sessions, at (ouch) £200-£300 each.

It’s available (for faces and chests as well) around the country, in clinics such as Waterhouse Young (waterhouse young.com), who have dubbed it the ‘Jet Set Pro Peel’, and Wakefield’s Face The Future (facethefuture.co.uk — email info@magroup.co.uk for a clinic near you).

A cheaper option is consistent use of the correct hand creams. Use one with peeling, plumping fruit acids overnight (Ameliorate Hand Treatment, £15) and a decent sunscreen by day (No7 Protect & Perfect Hand & Nail Cream, £11.50). Hands should look better in two months.
