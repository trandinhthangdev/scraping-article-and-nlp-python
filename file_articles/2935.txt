A lorry driver has been hailed a hero after he stopped his vehicle under a motorway bridge it was feared a woman was 'going to jump' from.

The unidentified woman was seen on a bridge at the N7 near Dublin as commuters travelled in and out of the city on Friday.

One quick-thinking motorist parked underneath the bridge in order to prevent her fall, appearing to fear she would 'jump' to the road.

Keith Dunne, who took the photograph, told the Mirror: 'She was going to jump at Naas today but an Artic lorry stopped under her.

'Not all heroes wear capes, it's not a nice time of year to feel like you have to end your life, talk to someone, anybody please.'

Another person, who shared the image on Facebook, said: 'Truck parked under the bridge so if she falls it's onto his trailer and people can quickly help.

'Well done and quick thinking trucker'.

Dozens of well-wishers took to the comments of the post to thank the unidentified driver for his selfless act.

'Truckers are just great, salute to you all', said one. 'This is one of the reason why we should appreciate these guys.'

Another added: 'Well done to the driver, he has saved a life today. Hats off to him'.

'Well Done Trucker, God bless you', said a third.
