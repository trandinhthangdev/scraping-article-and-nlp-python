Manchester United captain Ashley Young could leave Old Trafford as early as next month.

Young returned to the line-up against Colchester United in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night but has seen his first-team opportunities at full-back limited by the summer signing of Aaron Wan-Bissaka and emergence of young Brandon Williams.

The 34-year-old is in the last year of his contract and was expected to leave in the summer, but may now go in the January transfer window instead.

United's longest serving player, who signed from Aston Villa for £17million in 2011, has previously been linked with a move to Italy.

Nemanja Matic is also looking to leave Old Trafford but there has been no direct contact with Inter Milan despite speculation over a move to Serie A.

United are hopeful of signing a defensive midfielder next month as well as striking a deal for Red Bull Salzburg striker Erling Haaland, and will look to add a goal-scoring midfielder in the summer.
