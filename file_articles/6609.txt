Thieves have stolen 300,000 litres of water from a property in a drought-hit town.

A farmer in Evans Plains, about 10km south west of Bathurst in New South Wales, reported the huge load of water missing from two tanks on his property on Sunday.

New South Wales Police are now investigating.

Officers are asking anyone who saw water trucks in the area between December 9 and Sunday to contact Bathurst Police Station.

Police described the theft as a 'significant quantity of water' while the state continues to suffer through a prolonged drought.

So far the drought has prompted water restrictions in New South Wales to be raised to level two and has already caused many towns to run low on water.

Another water theft occurred in the state's far north last week when thieves set their sights on a council depot in small town Murwillumbah.

A Toyota Hilux ute that was fixed with a water tanker got away with 25,000 litres of drinking water on December 9.

Council General Manager Troy Green told ABC News that the 'theft of a very large volume of drinking water is a criminal act' and he would 'not tolerate any theft of this precious resource.'

The state and its people are feeling the effects of the country's desperate conditions as bushfires continue to ravage New South Wales and Australia experienced its hottest day ever recorded on Tuesday.
