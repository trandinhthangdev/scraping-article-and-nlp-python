Washington Redskins rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins is doubtful to return to Sunday's game against the New York Giants after suffering an ankle injury on the first play of the third quarter.

Haskins was sacked by the Giants' Markus Golden and Lorenzo Carter and was carted off the field.

The club initially termed Haskins as questionable to return but later downgraded his status.

Haskins had a solid first half for the Redskins, throwing for 133 yards and two scores on 12-for-15 passing and no interceptions.

Case Keenum replaced Haskins and threw a touchdown pass on Washington's second drive of the third quarter.

Washington right tackle Morgan Moses (knee) also left in the third quarter.
