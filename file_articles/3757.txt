This is the shocking moment a mother is brutally attacked in the street after confronting a shoplifter who stole a bottle of wine.

Michelle Batchelor, 38, visited an off-licence in Gravesend, Kent at around 5pm on Saturday to pick up supplies for her 19-month-old daughter.

But while she was in the queue at the Premier store, she noticed a man go behind the counter and take a bottle of wine.

She had been popping down to her local shop to get supplies for her 19-month-old child when she was attacked

The shopkeeper, also noticing the man's action, ordered him to get out as he was 'already barred'.

The man then reportedly got aggressive and passed the booze to his female companion.

Single mother Ms Batchelor attempted to intervene, but the woman confronted her shouting, 'what has it got to do with you?'

She was then dragged into the street where she was assaulted. She was kicked and had her hair pulled out.

Ms Batchelor said: 'At the end of the assault she spat on me. I've got a bald patch on my head and a bruise on my back.'

Shopworker Pauline Semple witnessed the incident inside the store, adding the man and woman had been in earlier that day.

She said: 'She pulled Michelle by the hair to the ground.'

The incident outside the shop was filmed by a bystander who had not witnessed the earlier confrontation inside.

It is believed the man and woman then went into the fish and chip shop next door.

Michelle has since contacted newly-elected MP Adam Holloway who has promised to follow up the incident with the authorities.

She is now appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Kent Police said inquiries remain ongoing with the victim and officers are reviewing all available CCTV.
