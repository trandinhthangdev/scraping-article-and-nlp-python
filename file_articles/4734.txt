Dec 20 (Reuters) - Australia's competition regulator said the federal court has ordered Volkswagen AG to pay A$125 million ($86 million) in penalties for allegedly making false representations about compliance with the country's diesel emission standards.

The penalty amount is the highest ever ordered by the court for contraventions of the Australian Consumer Law, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a statement on Friday.

"Volkswagen admitted that, when it sought approval to supply and import more than 57,000 vehicles into Australia between 2011 and 2015, it did not disclose to the Australian Government the existence of 'Two Mode' software," the ACCC said.
