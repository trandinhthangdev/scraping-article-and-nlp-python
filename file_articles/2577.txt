It can be boring sorting through selection boxes to find your favourite type of chocolate. That's why consumer group Which? carried out a study to find exactly what's in each tub.

Researchers rooted through boxes of national favourites Roses and Quality Street, as well as own-brand offerings from M&S, Waitrose and Sainsbury's.

Chocolates in each box were separated into four different categories - fudges, toffees and caramels; fruits and coffee cremes; solid chocolate; chocolate with nuts and praline - to find out which has the highest proportion of each.

M&S has the highest proportion of fudges, toffees and caramels (51 per cent), while Quality Street has the highest percentage of fruit and coffee flavours (37 per cent).

Which? also worked out which chocolate box was best value for money. Quality Street (£3.50 from Asda and Morrisons) came out on top at 54p per 100g.

Natalie Hitchins, Which? Head of Home Products and Services, said: 'When the chocolate boxes come out, it's a clear sign that Christmas is just around the corner.

'Our analysis reveals that whatever your tastes, there's a chocolate tub for you. Use our research to make sure you spend your money on one that will bring you the most joy this Christmas.'
