Round began his coaching career at Middlesbrough in 2001, working under Steve McClaren.

He then moved onto England with McClaren before a spell as a coach with Sam Allardyce at Newcastle United.

Round was then picked up by David Moyes, who made him his assistant manager at Everton in July 2008, before taking him to Manchester United in the summer of 2013 when he was made manager there.

The 49-year-old's last job in football saw him work as director of football at Aston Villa between 2016 and 2018.
