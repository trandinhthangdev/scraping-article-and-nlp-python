Reforms intended to make it easier to switch banks have been delayed for five months, the consumer competition watchdog says.

The Consumer Data Right was originally planned to be launched in February, allowing customers to access data about themselves held by businesses and direct this information to third parties of their choice, but is now due to start in July.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said the extra time would permit more testing of the system and "better ensure necessary security and privacy protections operate effectively".

Banking is the first area in which the CDR will apply and it is later expected to be extended to consumers dealing with energy and telecommunications companies.

The ACCC said on Friday that customers will be able to tell major banks to share their credit and debit card, deposit account and transaction account data from July 1 while mortgage and personal loan data could be directed to be shared after November 1.

Experian general manager of credit services and decision analytics Poli Konstantinidis said it was positive that a "considered approach" was being taken by the ACCC to bring in the changes.

"It's vital CDR is implemented effectively and regulated properly so consumers can have access to the wide ranging benefits," he said.
