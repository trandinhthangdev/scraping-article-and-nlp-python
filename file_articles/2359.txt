A strategic burn will be conducted in the Adelaide Hills as efforts continue to contain the devastating blaze that has destroyed homes, razed other buildings and claimed at least one life.

The Country Fire Service will conduct the burn on Sunday in the Cudlee Creek Forest Reserve along Kangaroo Creek with locals warned to expect increased smoke in the area and take necessary precautions.

So far the fire has burnt through 25,000 hectares within a 127 kilometre perimeter.

A watch-and-act message remains in place but the CFS says fire activity moderated during the night.

"There are still some areas within the fire ground with active fire," the CFS said.

"There are also large areas of unburnt vegetation with the potential to cause flare-ups."

From Sunday, residents will be allowed to return to their homes with authorities starting to lift restrictions and road closures.

At least one person has been killed in the Adelaide Hills fire with the discovery on Saturday of a body at Charleston.

More than 50 other people have been injured, including 23 firefighters and two police officers.

So far 15 homes have been confirmed destroyed along with 28 other buildings and 16 cars.

But that tally is expected to climb as the full extent of the devastation comes to light.

The Adelaide Hills fire was one of more than 100 that broke out on Friday as temperatures soared into the mid-40s across SA.

Altogether an estimated 40,000 hectares have been blackened, with losses of crops and stock expected to be significant.
