Hummingbird Resources is gearing up to restart drilling at its Yanfolila gold mine in Mali

What is it?

Hummingbird Resources is an AIM-listed gold miner with projects in Mali and Liberia, in West Africa. It joined the stock market in 2010.

What's the latest?

It is gearing up to restart drilling at its Yanfolila gold mine in Mali and to release a five-year plan for the project in early 2020.

It estimated there are 165,000 more ounces of gold at the site than it originally thought.

Who backs it?

Africa-focused fund Sustainable Capital is the largest shareholder, with a 13 per cent stake.

Odey Asset Management and other big-name institutions such as Jupiter, M&G Investment Management and Aberdeen Standard Investments all feature.

Why should you invest?

The company's profile has been raised after it struck a deal to supply jeweller Boodles with ethical gold.

It says it will make enough cash from its gold production to mean it can be debt-free in 2020.

And why you shouldn't

Production in Mali has previously been disrupted by heavy rains and weak infrastructure.

A fall in the price of gold could hit the company, while shares are down by 2.6 per cent so far this year.
