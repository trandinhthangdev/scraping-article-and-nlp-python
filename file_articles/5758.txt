Tammy Hembrow is used to having all eyes on her.

But the 25-year-old decided to turn the camera on her son Wolf, four, when she hit Movie World on the Gold Coast for some much-needed family time.

On Thursday, the blonde bombshell took to Instagram and shared footage of Wolf on the Road Runner rollercoaster to her 10.3 million followers.

'So much fun!' On Thursday, Tammy filmed her son Wolf, four, as he rode the Road Runner rollercoaster at Movieworld. Pictured, left to right, Wolf, daughter Saskia and Tammy

In the video, Wolf can be seen with his eyes blown wide, gritting his teeth in terror as he presses his cheek against his mother's arm.

Meanwhile, Tammy seemed to be having a great time on the children's ride, laughing happily at her son's funny reaction.

The buxom blonde captioned the post: 'Wolf on rollercoasters is my new favourite thing. So much fun!'

The social media mogul wore an all-white ensemble at the busy theme park's night event, White Christmas.

It comes after Tammy got candid about being a single mother in an interview with Women's Best, one of the brands she does promotional work for.

'Being a mum and running a business is still a juggling act for me,' the entrepreneur admitted to the publication.

'I honestly just try my best to manage my time and plan, but as a mum, you know that sometimes planning goes out the window.'

'I've definitely learned not to beat myself up about failure,' she continued.

The Gold Coast native added that being a mother has also made her 'more resilient'.
