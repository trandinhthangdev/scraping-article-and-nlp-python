BARCELONA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The leader of Catalonia's regional government Quim Torra said on Thursday he would appeal a ruling by the Spanish region's highest court that convicted him of disobedience and banned him from holding public office for 18 months.

The ban could take months to come into force if upheld after the appeal. The sentence stems from Torra's refusal to remove pro-independence symbols from public buildings despite orders from Spain's electoral committee.
