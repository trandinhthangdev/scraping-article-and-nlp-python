NEW YORK (AP) - Pittsburgh pitcher Andy Maldonado and free agent pitcher Daniel De Leon were each suspended for 72 games under baseball's minor league drug program on Friday following positive tests for the anabolic steroid Stanozolol.

Boston catcher Elih Marrero and free agent pitcher Cole Watts were each suspended for 50 games following positive tests for Amphetamine, a banned stimulant.

Maldonado, a 17-year-old right-hander, was 0-3 with an 8.62 ERA in 12 starts last season for Pirates1 of the rookie level Dominican Summer League.

DeLeon, an 18-year-old right-hander, was released by Texas in October after going 3-1 with a 6.81 ERA in 15 relief appearances during his second season with the DSL's Rangers2.

Marrero, a 22-year-old taken on the eighth round of the 2018 amateur draft, hit .205 with one homer and 18 RBIs in 35 games at Class A last season with Lowell of the New York-Penn League and Salem of the Carolina League.

Watts, a 24-year-old left-hander, was selected by Houston in the 31st round in 2017 and was 1-6 with a 7.71 ERA in seven starts and seven relief appearances this year for Isaho Falls of the rookie level Pioneer League. He was released in mid-November.

Fifty players have been suspended this year under the minor league drug program and eight under the major league program.
