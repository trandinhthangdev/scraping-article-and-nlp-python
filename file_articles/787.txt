The value of an investment fund run by a star City manager focusing on small firms has plunged by 60 per cent to £61million this year.

The Miton UK Smaller Companies fund, which is managed by investing veteran Gervais Williams, had assets worth £153million at the beginning of 2019, according to the data group Morningstar.

The plunge comes in the wake of Neil Woodford’s downfall this year and is likely to raise fresh fears that British retail investors could make big losses through funds backing stock market tiddlers.

These firms are risky to invest in and hard for managers to sell in a hurry as their stock isn’t traded widely, making them ‘illiquid’.

The UK Smaller Companies fund, founded in 2012, has around 80 per cent of its investments in companies on London’s junior AIM market. These include oil and gas investor Reabold Resources and radiation detection device maker Kromek.

Williams, 61, who runs the fund with Martin Turner, has focused on small firms since the Eighties.

Miton told The Sunday Times: ‘We are comfortable with the liquidity profile of this fund. It maintains an appropriate cash balance to meet day-to-day needs.’
