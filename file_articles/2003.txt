Max Malins inspired Saracens to this seven-try romp and was immediately compared to one of the game’s superstars.

Malins touched down twice in a performance that narrowed the gap between his side and LeiFDcester Tigers to 17 points and will send shivers down the spines of everyone at Welford Road.

The 22-year-old grew up playing fly-half but shone at 15 here as Saracens made light of the absence of former England full-back Alex Goode and Wales star Liam Williams.

Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said: ‘Max reminds me a little bit of a young Beauden Barrett who wants to play fly-half but played 15 in the early years for the Hurricanes and All Blacks.’

Bristol took the lead through Luke Morahan’s try and went further ahead through two Callum Sheedy penalties.

Mako Vunipola struck back before Malins scored just before half-time. He went clean through to help his side to a 14-13 lead and his second on 56 minutes was a prelude to an avalanche of points.

The second half was one-way traffic as Malins, Nick Tompkins (two), Ben Earl and Brad Barritt completed the rout at Allianz Park.

Bristol boss Pat Lam said: ‘We’ll just flush this one —there’s no point reviewing it. We’ll just get into Wasps next week. There’s nothing we can do about this game.’
