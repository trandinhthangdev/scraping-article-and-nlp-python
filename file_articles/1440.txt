A serial sex offender who abused his own daughters will walk free from jail despite concerns he poses a serious danger to the community.

The 80-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spent the past 12 years in a Queensland jail for a series of offences including forcing his teenage daughters to perform oral sex on him.

The man is likely to be a risk for most of the rest of his life, Queensland Supreme Court Justice Peter Davis said in a judgement published on Friday.

An 80-year-old man is being released from jail after spending 12 years behind bars for sexual offences against young girls

The man served a 12-year sentence after pleading guilty in 2008 to a series of sexual offences against children, and was due for release in July.

He was kept in custody on an interim order after an application by the attorney-general under Queensland's dangerous prisoner laws, but will be released in the coming weeks.

His two daughters were between five and 13 when he performed oral sex on them, forced them to perform oral sex on him and raped them.

The man also pleaded guilty to committing a sexual offence on a six-year-old girl who was visiting his neighbour.

He was between 34 and 46 years old at the time of the offences.

The man suffers from worsening dementia that could increase the likelihood of him offending against children, Justice Davis said.

The risk would not reduce until the man was incapacitated to the point where offending became unlikely.

He will be forced to live under strict conditions including staying in secure accommodation and supervised by a corrective services officer for 10 years.
