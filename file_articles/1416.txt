Tottenham are considering recalling Jack Clarke from Leeds because he is struggling for minutes at Elland Road this season.

Spurs bought the winger in the summer for £8.5million from the Yorkshire club but loaned him straight back to continue his development.

But that has not gone to plan according to The Sun as Clarke has managed just 134 minutes this campaign.

Marcelo Bielsa could lose Arsenal loanee Eddie Nketiah as well as he has not started a game this season.

The Gunners forward has cored six goals in all competitions this season but all of his 13 appearances this campaign have come off the bench.

Patrick Bamford has cemented his spot in the starting XI as he is the top scorer at the club.

But at Tottenham, it will be interesting to see whether Clarke can get any game time under Jose Mourinho who is not known for trusting in youth like his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino.

Clarke made 24 appearances last campaign which attracted Spurs to buy the Leeds winger.
