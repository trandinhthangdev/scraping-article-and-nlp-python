Hertha Berlin are ready to offer Granit Xhaka an escape from Arsenal.

The German side, managed by former Tottenham striker Jurgen Klinsmann, want to bring in a new midfield anchorman next month and have been alerted by Xhaka's uncertain future at Arsenal.

Xhaka, 27, told the club he wants to leave after a huge spat with the club's supporters in October. German publication BILD believe he could return to Germany for a staggering £38million.

The Swiss star reacted furiously when he was jeered as he was subbed against Crystal Palace, firstly cupping his ears and then telling supporters to 'f*** off'. The incident led to Xhaka being stripped of the captaincy and left out of five successive Arsenal games.

When he eventually explained his furious reaction Xhaka revealed he blew his top due to the sickening personal abuse aimed at him and his family, online and in person.

The fallout occurred while Unai Emery was in charge and it remains to be seen if the Spaniard's departure and Mikel Arteta's imminent appointment will lead to a change of heart.

Arsenal were equally open to offloading Xhaka and had identified Germany as a potential market.

Xhaka remains well-regarded in Germany after spending four years at Borussia Monchengladbach and is now being lined up for a return to the Bundesliga by Hertha.
