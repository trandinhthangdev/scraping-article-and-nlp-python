In a segment on Live! this past October, when CNN's Anderson Cooper was sitting in for Ryan Seacrest, Kelly said her daughter's transition to independent living was seamless.

'When she was a little girl, like, three-years-old, she used to play dorm room in her bedroom. First she played sleep away camp, then she played dorm room,' she explained.

'So this is like a girl who was meant to live away from us - she was born to live outside of the house!'

The family of five reunited to pose together for this year's Christmas card which Kelly shared via social media.
