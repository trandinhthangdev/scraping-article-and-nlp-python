A family-owned winery in the Adelaide Hills has felt the brunt of a devastating bushfire losing a prized vineyard but emerging with its buildings largely intact.

Golding Wines near Lobethal was in the path of a fire sparked during catastrophic conditions on Friday which had burnt through more than 10,000 hectares by the end of the day.

Lucy Golding said its Western Branch Vineyard had been badly damaged but the company's barn and tasting rooms were okay and the family's house had also survived.

Her husband Darren had stayed behind to defend the property with the help of Country Fire Service crews.

"The threat has not gone, Darren remains there dealing with spot fires and I know there are many others in the Hills fighting to protect their properties right now," Ms Golding said in a Facebook post.

"Friends and neighbours are suffering losses. My heart aches for our hills community on this blackest of days. We are down but not out."

Late on Friday and emergency warning remained in place for the fire which was sparked near Cudlee Creek, most likely when a falling tree brought down power lines.

It destroyed homes and other buildings in a number of towns, including Lobethal and Woodside.

A number of police and firefighters were also injured in the blaze which was one of several burning across SA including others sparking emergency alerts.
