After finding fame in Big Brother, Imogen modelled and launched her own swimwear brand, Chasing Summer, in 2015 after she struggled to find bikinis and costumes to fit her curves.

But in April, Imogen revealed she has closed her swimsuit business after 'losing motivation' for the venture in the wake of her split from her ex Adam.

She said: 'The past 11 months has been the most challenging time of my life. Becoming a single parent has changed me as a person.'

'When my relationship broke down so did my aspirations for my business.'

'My motivation has not returned so after thinking hard this year I've decided it's time to say goodbye to Chasing Summer.'

'It's been a great few years but my priorities now lie with my two beautiful girls and I simply just do not have the time and energy that the business needs.'
