An outback Queensland town has sparked outrage after announcing plans to build a waterski park - despite being in their eighth consecutive year of drought.

Residents in Barcaldine, near Longreach in western Queensland, have called plans to fill a huge lake on the outskirts of town as 'irresponsible' due to the scarcity of water in the region.

Barcaldine Regional Council has already excavated the site and are waiting for a water licence to get approval to access a bore and fill the lake with 400 megalitres of water.

Barcaldine Mayor Rob Chandler said the lake will take five months to fill up, with locals fuming at the council considering using such a precious resource for recreation.

'There has been a lot of talk amongst the graziers,' former mayoral candidate Sharon Broughton told the ABC. 'To them, water is their absolute lifeblood.'

Cr Chandler believes the waterski park will put the town on the map and keep young professionals in the area by providing an exciting facility for after work activities.

Traditional custodian Suzanne Thompson quashed the council's idea.

'It is probably the most irresponsible thing we could actually do right now in the current climate, especially out here,' Ms Thompson said.

She noted that the proposed lake is on a site of cultural significance for Aboriginal people.

'We found cultural heritage all the way through. Our family had their camps and stuff here,' Ms Thompson said.

The Department of Natural Resources has been contacted by the Barcaldine Regional Council but had not received a water licence application.
