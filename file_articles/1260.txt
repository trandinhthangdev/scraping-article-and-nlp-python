Gasparilla Bowl: Central Florida (9-3, 6-2 American) vs. Marshall (8-4, 6-2 Conference USA), Monday at 2:30 p.m. EST (ESPN).

Line: UCF by 17 1/2.

Series record: UCF 8-3.

WHAT'S AT STAKE

Concerns about a letdown may be tempered with UCF playing about 100 miles from its Orlando campus in nearby Tampa, Florida. The Knights played in New Year's Day bowl games the previous two seasons, beating Auburn two years ago in the Peach Bowl and losing to LSU in the last season's Fiesta Bowl. Marshall has a knack for bowl success under coach Doc Holliday; the Thundering Herd are 6-0.
