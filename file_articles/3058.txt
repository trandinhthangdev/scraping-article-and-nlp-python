Children as young as six may have picked the hazelnuts used in Ferrero Rocher chocolates, a human rights group claims.

Ferrero, which also makes Nutella, buys around 30 per cent of the nuts it uses from Turkey – where child labour is common.

Turkish government records from 2012 found that some 900,000 children worked in sectors including farming. It was estimated that 11,300 of those were aged between six and 14.

Ferrero Rocher said it was contacting their suppliers to confirm they were working within the firm's strict ethical guidelines

Reports from Turkey found that 900,000 children work in the country, some of whom pick hazelnuts, which are an ingredient used by Ferrero Rocher in their chocolates Campaigners claim companies should pay a fair price for hazelnuts so workers could receive a living wage

Giulio Carini, of British campaign group WeMove Europe, told The Guardian it was asking Ferrero ‘to support a fair price for hazelnuts in Turkey to ensure workers get a living wage income and eliminate child labour throughout its supply chain’.

Ferrero said it will ‘immediately contact the supplier and check the conditions’, according to its ‘strict’ code of business ethics.
