Troy Deeney insists Watford's 2-0 win over Manchester United had been coming.

The Hornets skipper added a second from the penalty spot after a David de Gea howler gifted Nigel Pearson's side their second win of the season.

Deeney said on Sky Sports: 'We've been close for ages now.

'People are looking and see us at the bottom of the league but performances like Liverpool, Leicester before that, there are games we're thinking we should have won.

'It was a great team performance, lots of people did a proper shift and I'm happy for everyone here that they can have a decent Christmas.'

The striker hailed the influence of new manager Nigel Pearson and said: 'He's been instrumental in getting everyone to work hard and enjoy what we're doing again.

'You could see how we celebrated that last free-kick and you had people throwing their bodies on the line.'

The three points only brought Watford level with 19th-placed Norwich and still six adrift of safety.

And Deeney said: 'We don't take anything for granted. We've won one game, it doesn't mean we're going to go and win six in a row.

'We're still bottom of the league, we've got to keep working.'
