Stanford tight end Colby Parkinson announced Friday that he is bypassing his senior season to enter the NFL draft.

Parkinson, who caught 48 passes for 589 yards and one touchdown this season, said he feels he is ready to take the next step.

"This decision was not an easy one, but after lots of thought and prayer with my family and loved ones, I believe this to be the best decision for me," Parkinson wrote on his Twitter account. "I have been dreaming of playing in the NFL since I started playing football in the first grade and I could not be more excited to begin this new chapter."

The 6-foot-7, 251-pound Parkinson is considered one of the top five prospects at his position.

Parkinson finishes his college career with 87 receptions for 1,171 yards and 12 touchdowns in 31 games.
