Climate protesters have briefly blocked a central Sydney street as they demand the Australian government declares a climate emergency.

Demonstrators connected to the Extinction Rebellion movement on Friday morning set up at the intersection of Pitt Street and Martin Place, gluing themselves to Christmas-themed props.

"Our rebel elves showed more climate leadership at this action than the government has shown in its entire existence," the climate advocacy group posted on their Facebook page on Friday.

They have since been extricated and moved on by police.

The protest follows a "camp-out" at Scott Morrison's prime ministerial residence in Sydney on Thursday, which prompted 10 arrests, including a Greens MP.

NSW upper-house member David Shoebridge was among activists outside Kirribilli House demanding urgent action amid unprecedented bushfires.

NSW Police on Thursday afternoon said nine adults and a child had been arrested for disobeying a direction to move on.

Protesters, including students representing the School Strike 4 Climate movement, set up tents on the road outside Mr Morrison's official residence on Thursday morning, calling it the "Kirribilli camp-out".

They called on the federal government to take immediate action on climate change and urged no new coal and gas projects, a transition to 100 per cent renewables and funding for affected fossil fuel workers.

Mr Shoebridge said it had been a "pretty good reason to get arrested".

Mr Morrison had been on a family break at the time of the protest but has since declared he will return to work in Sydney as soon as possible.
