DUBAI, Dec 19 (Reuters) - A man arrested in Saudi Arabia after stabbing three performers at a live show in the capital Riyadh last month was under orders from a leader of Al Qaeda in Yemen, state television channel Ekhbariya said on Thursday.

The Nov. 11 incident occurred at King Abdullah Park, one of several venues hosting a two-month long entertainment festival as part of government efforts to open up Saudi society and diversify its economy away from oil. (Writing by Lisa Barrington; Editing by Alison Williams)
