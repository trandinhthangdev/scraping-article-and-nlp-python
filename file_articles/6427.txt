Sadio Mane was full of praise for his 'very good friend' Mo Salah and even sung Egyptian King - a fan favourite often head from the crowd at Anfield - when asked about his relationship with his Liverpool team-mate.

The pair clashed during a game at Burnley earlier in the season when Mane was furious that Salah didn't pass to him for an easy opportunity to score.

It was an incident that led to some speculation that they were at loggerheads but both players since moved to allay those fears.

To which the Senegalese responded: 'What kind of problem? People, keep supporting Salah, he's doing everything for Egypt and keeps fighting for Egypt so see you soon in Egypt.'

The Egyptian King is sung to the tune of Sit Down, the 1990 hit by Manchester band James.

Both men are in a rich vein of form at the moment and will hope to help Liverpool to their first Club World Cup trophy.

Salah started the game on Wednesday with Mane coming off the bench as Jurgen Klopp's side slotted a late winner through Roberto Firmino to advance.

They will take on Brazilian side Flamengo in the final on Saturday afternoon.
