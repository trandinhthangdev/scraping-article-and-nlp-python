A serial rapist who first offended when he was a teenager more than 40 years ago will be held behind bars indefinitely.

The only way to protect the community from Stephen Robert Banwell, 59, is to imprison him, a Queensland court has found.

Banwell, who was first convicted in the Penrith Children's Court in 1975 for indecently assaulting a woman, had been due to be released from custody next week.
