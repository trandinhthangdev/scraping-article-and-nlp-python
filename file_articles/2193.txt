Philadelphia Eagles running back Darren Sproles announced his retirement on Saturday.

The 15-year-veteran is out for the season with a torn right hip flexor muscle and played just six games in 2019.

"I owe so much to the game of football and I gave it all I had in return," Sproles said in a statement posted on the Eagles' website. "I gave it everything I had on every play. I rode it until the wheels fell off. That's the way I played and that's the way I practiced. When I re-signed with the Eagles back in July, I knew it was going to be my last season, and now my body is telling me it's time to step away from the game. It's time to call it a career. So when the season comes to an end, I'm going to officially retire from the National Football League. But I wanted to announce it today so that we can appreciate the moment together on Sunday."

The Eagles (7-7) host the Dallas Cowboys (7-7) in a crucial NFC East showdown. It's the last home game for the Eagles, and Sproles will be a captain for the game.

In limited action this season, the 36-year-old gained 66 yards on 17 carries.

The 5-foot-6 Sproles entered the league in 2005, as a fourth-round draft pick of the San Diego Chargers. He spent six seasons with the Chargers, followed by three with the New Orleans Saints and then six with the Eagles.

A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Sproles played in 183 regular-season games, rushing for 3,552 yards and 23 touchdowns. He was a valuable weapon for his quarterbacks, including Drew Brees and Philip Rivers, catching 553 passes for 4,840 yards and 32 touchdowns. He added nine TDs on punt (seven) and kickoff (two) returns.

He retires as No. 5 on the NFL's all-time list for all-purpose yards gained with 19,696.
