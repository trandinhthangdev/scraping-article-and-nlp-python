The two-decade-long windup of Alan Bond's failed Bell Group is closer to an end with a proposed settlement agreement to allow $1.9 billion to be distributed among creditors.

The Insurance Commission of Western Australia has entered into a deed of settlement as a result of lengthy and intensive negotiations to resolve the court action.

The settlement is conditional on approvals being obtained by liquidators in various Australian and overseas courts and on creditors' and court approvals for a number for arrangements across a number of companies in the Bell Group.

But WA Treasurer Ben Wyatt said if those approvals are obtained, the case could be wound up in 12 months.

"The Bell litigation has long been a distraction and consumed an inordinate amount of time and resources for all parties," Mr Wyatt said on Saturday.

"I hope this represents the start of the end for Bell and the matter is resolved in the interest of WA taxpayers."

The battle for the funds held by the Bell Group liquidators has raged for more than 20 years and has cost hundreds of millions of dollars in legal and other fees so far.
