Evan Battey finished with 20 points, including going 10 of 11 from the free-throw line, in Colorado's 83-64 win over Prairie View A&M in a nonconference game Thursday night at Boulder, Colo.

The Buffaloes (9-2) made 26 of 28 shots from the line to make up for their 5-of-20 performance from 3-point range.

Battey also had nine rebounds, leading Colorado to a 43-29 edge on the boards. Tyler Bey had 13 points and seven rebounds, D'Shawn Schwartz finished with 13 points, and McKinley Wright had 11 points, seven rebounds and six assists.

Gerard Andrus had 12 points and Devonte Patterson finished with 11 for Prairie View (3-8).

The Buffaloes led 35-28 at halftime despite allowing the Panthers to take 15 more field goal attempts because of Prairie View's seven offensive rebounds and Colorado's eight turnovers. The Panthers made 13 of 38 shots while the Buffaloes were 10 of 23.

Colorado was also 13 of 14 from the free throw line by halftime; Prairie View was 1 of 2.

Wright had nine points on 3-of-4 shooting from the field with four rebounds in the first half.

The Buffaloes looked like they could gain separation, building a 48-37 lead with 13:30 left in regulation, but Darius Williams fueled a 6-0 spurt with four points to close the lead to 48-43 with 10:58 left.

Colorado finally put together its knockout run, scoring 10 unanswered points (including two 3-pointers by Schwartz) to take a 66-49 lead with 6:03 remaining.

Prairie View has lost games at Central Florida, Texas, California and Arizona State. The Panthers' margin of defeat against Colorado is the largest, with the 70-56 loss against the Longhorns the previous biggest loss.

The Panthers, who have not played at home since their season opener, next play at Seton Hall on Sunday.

Colorado plays No. 13 Dayton at Chicago on Saturday.
