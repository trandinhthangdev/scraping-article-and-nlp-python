The fire broke out early in the morning in New Delhi's Kirari area. Its cause was not immediately known, an official with the Delhi Fire Service said. It took about three hours to contain the fire.

It was the second major fire in New Delhi this month. On Dec. 8, a fire believed to be caused by an electrical short circuit engulfed a building in the capital, killing at least 43 people.
