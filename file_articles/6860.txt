Dec 19 (Reuters) - Bank of England said on Wednesday that a third-party supplier accessed the audio feed of some of its press conferences without consent.

The third-party supplier, whom Bank of England did not name, had been misusing the audio feed since earlier this year, the bank said in a statement.

"This wholly unacceptable use of the audio feed was without the Bank's knowledge or consent, and is being investigated further," it added. (Reporting by Akshay Balan in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni)
