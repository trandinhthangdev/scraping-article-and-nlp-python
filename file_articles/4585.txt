Pierre-Luc Dubois scored 1:11 into overtime to lift the Columbus Blue Jackets to a 3-2 win over the visiting Los Angeles Kings on Thursday night.

Dubois and Zach Werenski each had a goal and an assist, Gustav Nyquist had two assists, Boone Jenner scored late in regulation, and Joonas Korpisalo made 23 saves for the Blue Jackets, who improved to 4-0-2 in their past six games.

Adrian Kempe and Jeff Carter scored, and Jack Campbell made 25 saves for the Kings, who dropped to 4-0-2 in their past six games. Los Angeles lost for the first time this season when leading after two periods, ending a 10-0-0 run.

The Blue Jackets pulled Korpisalo for an extra attacker with about 2:20 left, and Werenski sent a point shot into traffic that Jenner deflected past Campbell to tie the score 2-2 with 1:43 remaining.

The Kings had protected a 2-1 lead since Carter scored at 11:16 of the second period.

Kyle Clifford centered the puck from off the boards in the Blue Jackets' zone. The puck went off the blade of three different players before ending up in the slot, where Carter spun and shot it into the net for his 11th goal of the season.

The Kings took their first lead 42 seconds into the game when Korpisalo was unable to glove the puck on a point shot, and Kempe scored on the rebound for a 1-0 lead.

Columbus improved to 2-11-5 this season when allowing the first goal.

The Blue Jackets tied the score at 1-1 with a power-play goal at 2:55 of the first period.

Nyquist faked a shot from the left point before passing to Werenski at the right point. His slap shot sailed through traffic, under Campbell's glove and into the net.

The Blue Jackets lost Cam Atkinson to a lower-body injury during the second period. Atkinson came into the game third on the team in points with 21 (nine goals, 12 assists).
