Backup goaltender Michael Hutchinson stopped 29 shots to earn his first win of the season, Zach Hyman and Auston Matthews each had two goals and an assist and the Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the visiting Detroit Red Wings 4-1 Saturday night.

Hutchison is 1-5-1 for the season and gave Toronto its first win from a backup goaltender since March 20.

Mitch Marner added two assists for the Maple Leafs, who have won four straight.

Tyler Bertuzzi scored for Detroit on a power play at 18:16 of the third period.

Detroit's Jonathan Bernier stopped all three shots he faced before leaving at 6:52 of the first period with a lower-body injury. He was replaced by Calvin Pickard, who made 16 saves for the Red Wings, who have lost three consecutive games.

It was the third meeting this season between the teams, with Toronto having won the first two in Detroit.

Hutchinson stopped a breakaway and made another good stop on a close-in chance during the first period.

Pickard made a good save on Trevor Moore, who broke in alone about eight minutes into the second.

Hyman gave the Maple Leafs the lead at 17:10 of the second period after he broke in alone and was brought down by Detroit's Mike Green, whose slide pushed the puck toward the net. A video review ruled the puck had crossed the goal line before the net was dislodged from its moorings. Morgan Rielly earned the assist.

Matthews scored on a shot from the left circle on a power play at 2:18 of the third period. Detroit's Filip Zadina was serving a tripping penalty.

Hyman scored his eighth of the season at 8:51 of the third on a backhand after a pass from Matthews.

Matthews scored his 23rd of the season from the slot at 13:39 of the third.

The game became chippy with two skirmishes in the final two minutes, Toronto's Jake Muzzin was assessed an unsportsmanlike penalty as well as a roughing penalty. Each team had a fighting major and Detroit had two roughing penalties.
