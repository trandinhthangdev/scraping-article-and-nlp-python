Well it is the season of love and good cheer to all.

And Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell seem to have taken that to heart as they enjoy a shopping splurge during a holiday getaway in Aspen. Colorado.

The couple hit the boutiques in the downtown district of the ski resort on Friday.

Holiday shopping for two! Goldie Hawn got some last-minute shopping done with her beau Kurt Russell in Aspen, Colorado

Meanwhile, she and Kurt, 68, both posted stills from The Christmas Chronicles.

Goldie, 74, captioned hers, 'A year later and I’m still ringing Santa’s jingle bells.

'I couldn’t be happier to be working on @christmaschronicles again with Kurt Russell, my real life Santa,' and the actress, who plays Mrs Klaus, credited @netflix 2020.

Dressed to avoid the chill: The 74-year-old looked cute in a cowboy hat, a pink padded jacket. black skinny jeans, sheepskin-lined leg warmers and black boots

Warm and chic: Kurt, 68, sported a full Santa Klaus beard, a heavy jacket that he wore over a blue striped rugby shirt, pale blue jeans and waterproof shoes to keep his feet dry in the snow

Meanwhile, Kurt posted a video on Instagram asking, 'What are your Christmas traditions?'

He goes on to explain, 'When Christmas dinner is done, the kids get in their special pajamas, their Christmas pajamas.

'We sit around the fire and we always pick someone to read 'Twas The Night Before Christmas.

'As soon as the poem has been read don't be surprised if you begin to hear bells and if you catch a glimpse of Santa Claus.'

The Santa he means, of course, is the one he plays in Netflix's 2018 movie The Christmas Chronicles, which is now a holiday staple.

And he'll be back next year, as Goldie said, in The Christmas Chronicles 2, due out in 2020r.
