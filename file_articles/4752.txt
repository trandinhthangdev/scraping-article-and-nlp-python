The parents of Harry Dunn will meet officials at the Crown Prosecution Service today to learn whether the American woman who is said to have collided with him will be charged.

Harry, 19, was killed when his motorcycle collided with a Volvo SUV being driven on the wrong side of the road by Anne Sacoolas, close to her intelligence officer husband's US base in Northamptonshire.

Mrs Sacoolas later fled the country with her family following the collision in August, claiming diplomatic immunity.

Harry's parents Tim Dunn, 50, and Charlotte Charles, 44, want Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK to 'face justice', and they have been exploring civil actions against her both in Britain and the US.

The parents met Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday. He told them the Government is doing 'everything it can' to get justice.

After the meeting, Mr Raab said: 'If there is a charging decision, I urge Mrs Sacoolas to come back to the United Kingdom and co-operate with the criminal justice process.'
