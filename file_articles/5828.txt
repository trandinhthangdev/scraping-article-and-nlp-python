Scott Morrison has been urged to use his semi-regular summits with state and territory leaders to set out a reform plan to boost jobs and investment.

The Business Council of Australia said in its pre-budget submission the Council of Australian Governments needed to prioritise reforming state-based red tape.

Areas to be overhauled should include major project approval processes, development approvals, retail trading hours and payroll tax compliance.

States and territories would be awarded "productivity payments" if their processes met what was considered best practice - rather than the more difficult path of trying to get them all to agree on a common set of laws.

Business Council chief Jennifer Westacott told AAP improving such processes would make it easier to invest in Australia, export goods and services, approve projects and products, and pay small business suppliers quickly and on time.

"There is duplication, there is overlap and we have to - over the long term - sort these things out," she said.

COAG should also seek agreement on the extent and sequencing of public infrastructure investment over 20 to 30 years.

COAG is due to next meet on March 13.
