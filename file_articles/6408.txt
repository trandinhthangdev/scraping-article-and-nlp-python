The wife of an active-duty Marine stationed in Camp Pendleton has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old foreign exchange student who was living with her family on the San Diego base.

Nicole Marie Wilson, 22, was charged with sexual abuse of a minor on Tuesday in San Diego federal court.

The 22-year-old had a plea of not guilty entered on her behalf, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports.

The teen reported the alleged abuse to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) on September 30, according to an affidavit filed in the federal court.

He claimed that 10 days prior, he returned home from a high school football game and was accosted by Williams while he watched TV on the couch.

The teen explained to authorities that Wilson asked him 'yes or no' before performing a sex act on him, to which he responded 'O.K.'

When asked again, the teen reportedly told Wilson 'no' but shared that she continued with the sex act.

According to the affidavit, Wilson reportedly stopped her assault once she heard her infant cry in another room.

Wilson told NCIS investigators that she had been drinking and 'blacked out' while watching TV with the teenage boy. She claimed that she snapped out of it once she heard her baby cry.

Court records show that the woman had sent the teen WhatsApp messages apologizing for the encounter but asking him if he liked it.

The teen responded to the woman that he wanted to forget the whole ordeal and expressed that he didn't want her husband to know in fear of impacting his exchange program.

A federal prosecutor on Tuesday asked that Wilson be detained without bond, calling her a 'serious risk of flight and danger to the community.'

A detention hearing for Wilson is scheduled for Thursday.
