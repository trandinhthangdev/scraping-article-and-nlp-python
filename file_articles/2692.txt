Rio Olympic sailor Jake Lilley has fired a warning shot ahead of a likely Tokyo Games return, winning the Finn Gold Cup medal race in Melbourne on Saturday.

The Queenslander finished the meet fifth overall, but will leave with a statement-making first place in the final top-10 medal race held in tricky conditions at Port Phillip Bay.

His performance sewed up a quota spot for Australia in the Finn class in Tokyo next year and gave Lilley confidence he could match the world's best.

"I've had wins before or other good events, but I think this right now is the highest quality Finn fleet we have ever seen," he said.

"It's really tight at the top so anytime you finish top five or top ten is a great result.

"Obviously, we are aiming to take medals but this is a great step in the right direction."

Rio gold medallist Giles Scott was fourth, with New Zealand's Josh Junior a wire-to-wire victor ahead of Dutch sailor Nicholas Heiner and Hungary's defending world champion Zsombor Berecz.
