Washington Wizards basketball star Isaiah Thomas confronted two Philadelphia 76ers fans who made obscene gestures and swore at him in the stands in an effort to distract him and potentially win a free Wendy's Frosty.

The two fans, who were not named, ended up being banned from the 76ers Wells Fargo Center for the disruption and had their season ticket privileges revoked.

During the game on Saturday, the two 76ers fans jeered the point guard as he was making free throws.

Thomas became so fed up with the taunts near the end of the fourth quarter that he walked off the court and entered the stands to confront the pair, claiming one held both middle fingers up and yelled 'F**k you, b***h' three times at him.

When Thomas confronted the man, he said: 'I’m sorry. I just wanted a Frosty'. Wendy's and the 76ers have a promotion where if an opposing team loses two free throws, 76ers fans get a free Frosty

Viral video shows the moment Thomas walks off the court and calmly confronts the pair saying: 'Don't do that man. You're fans. Don't do that. Just don't do that.'

In the background a male voice is heard saying, 'Where's the Wendy's Frosty?'

Thomas' security is seen with him trying to pull him away from the situation.

The 30-year-old was ejected from the game for breaking the rules and entering the stands and may face punishment from the league.

In the end those two 76ers fans were punished too, hit with a 12-month ban from the Wells Fargo Center, a team spokesman said Sunday.

Those fans, whose names were not released, admitted to arena security that they used inappropriate language and gestures, which violated the arena's conduct policy, according to the Washington Post.

Those fans were sitting in Section 120, which belongs to 76ers season ticket holders. The team revoked the ticket owner's privileges and issued a refund for the rest of the season.

The 30-year-old point guard shocked the stadium when he walked off court - which is in violation of NBA rules for players - to confront the jeering fans

He ended up reporting them to security and they confessed to using inappropriate language and gestures against Thomas. They were issued as 12-month ban from the Wells Fargo Stadium

On Saturday night Thomas said he was confidence the NBA would understand his perspective in the altercation.

Thomas relived the moment for reporters, saying he missed his first free throw and made a second, then spotted the man giving him the middle finger.

'So then the timeout goes, and I go in the stands to confront him,' he said.

'I say, "Don’t be disrespectful. I’m a man before anything and be a fan," Thomas told the 76ers fan.

Thomas didn't tweet about the incident himself but shared this tweet by a friend, commending his calm confrontation

"A fan has both of his middle fingers up, and said 'F--- you, b----' three times. ... I go in the stands to confront him. ... His response was, 'I'm sorry. I just wanted a Frosty.'"

'I’m sorry. I just wanted a Frosty because if you miss two free throws, I guess the fans get a Frosty,' the 76ers fan replied.

The 76ers had been promoting a 'Wendy's Frosty Freeze-Out' which offers free desserts for fans if 'an opposing player misses two consecutive free-throw attempts in the second half of a 76ers home game.'

'The league knows: I did nothing wrong. There just should be a respect factor [with fans]. Like, I’m not going to go to anybody else’s job and call you out of your name, no matter how mad I make you. I don’t even know how I can make you that mad when we were down 15. We lost the game. That’s all I’m saying. I’m a man before anything, and that just wasn’t OK to do — and I just had to say something,' Thomas said.

Wizards Coach Scott Brooks however condemned Thomas' conduct in breaking the rules and entering the stands, saying 'there's no reason' to do so.

'Maybe there’s one [reason], but I’ll keep that between me and myself. . . . But, no, I don’t know what happened,' he said.

In the end the Wizards lost to the Sixers 125-108.
