Gary Neville has questioned Jose Mourinho's commitment during his tenure as Manchester United boss.

The Portuguese led United to Europa League success in 2017, followed by a second-place Premier League finish and FA Cup final defeat in 2018.

But United won just seven of their first 17 league games in the 2018-19 season; a run which led to his dismissal in December 2018.

And former Red Devils player Neville believes Mourinho 'lost his charm' towards the end of his reign at Old Trafford.

Neville told Sky Sports: ‘United was a difficult time for the club, he’s spent six months out reflecting on his time and the way he talks to the media.

'He lost his charm at United. It looked like a chore for him, questioning the media a lot.

Mourinho has made a strong start to life as Tottenham manager since taking the helm

Mourinho stayed in the Lowry Hotel throughout his two-and-a-half years in Manchester, and Neville suggests this indicated his lack of dedication to the club.

'The hotel was a poor PR move with his family down in London. He looks passionate about football now. His park the bus style is not good for him now.’

The 56-year-old was appointed Tottenham manager in November, resulting in five wins and two defeats from his first seven games in charge.
