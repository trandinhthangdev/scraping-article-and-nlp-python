Danny Murphy said he was 'gobsmacked' the referee didn't send off Flamengo defender Rafinha for a foul on Sadio Mane during the Club World Cup final.

Referee Abdulrahman Al Jassim initially awarded a spot-kick after Mane was felled by Rafinha as he ran through on goal in injury-time.

Flamengo players surrounded Al Jassim to protest the decision and the official decided to consult VAR to double check.

After initial replays appeared inconclusive, he then watched multiple replays on a monitor before making his final decision.

Eventually, he returned to the pitch and overturned his original decision, while ruling that Mane hadn't even been fouled.

Murphy was left stunned and felt the referee had made an error: 'It was a tight decision over the penalty,' he told BBC Sport. 'I’m a bit gobsmacked it wasn’t at least a foul.

'It looks like a deliberate lunge by Rafinha. You can see him just touch the bottom of Mane’s boot. To say there’s no contact there and no punishment is just bizarre. It’s definitely a red card.'

The game went to extra-time and the Reds eventually got the breakthrough their efforts deserved when Roberto Firmino fired home inside the 18-yard box.
