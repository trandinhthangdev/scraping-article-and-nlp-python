LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out his government's legislative agenda on Thursday, describing it as "the most radical Queen's Speech in a generation".

Johnson, whose Conservatives won a large majority at a Dec. 12 election, vowed to deliver Britain's exit from the European Union at the end of January before moving his attention to domestic priorities including healthcare and policing.

"We have no time to waste and we begin immediately with the most radical Queen's Speech in a generation to deliver on the priorities of the British people," he said in the foreword to the Queen's Speech, which sets out plans for the coming year and lists the legislation the government aims to pass.

"Our ambition is nothing short of a complete transformation of our country for the better." (Reporting by Kylie MacLellan, Editing by Elizabeth Piper)
