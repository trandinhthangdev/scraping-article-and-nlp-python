Australian coach Justin Langer has removed any lingering doubt that James Pattinson will replace the injured Josh Hazlewood in the line-up for the Boxing Day Test.

Langer raised eyebrows when he brought veteran quick Peter Siddle into the 13-man squad this week, but the coach has confirmed Pattinson will get the nod ahead of Michael Neser and Siddle.

"I am really looking forward to seeing Patto bowl and bowl well in this Boxing Day Test, which is his home ground as well," Langer told 6PR on Saturday.
