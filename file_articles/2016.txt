Tyrell Terry had 13 of his 20 points in the second half to help Stanford defeat San Diego 62-59 on Saturday afternoon in the opening game of the Al Attles Classic in San Francisco, Calif.

Oscar Da Silva contributed 19 points, 11 rebounds and five steals for the Cardinal, who improved to 11-1 for the first time since 2007-08 when they won 28 games and reached the Sweet 16.

Sophomore guard Joey Calcaterra had 17 points and Marlon Humphrey added 16 for San Diego, which dropped to 0-3 this season against Pac-12 teams. Braun Hartfield added 13 points and nine rebounds.

Stanford used a late 7-0 run to take a 31-29 halftime lead after trailing for nearly all of the first 20 minutes, mostly due to shaky ball-handling that resulted in 10 first-half turnovers. The Cardinal finished with 20 turnovers but the second-half giveaways weren't nearly as costly.

A 7-0 run early in the second half opened things up for the Cardinal. Later, Terry's 3-pointer with 13:19 left put them up 43-35.

San Diego (6-8) used a 9-2 run to get within 45-44 with 9:03 left but then went nearly six minutes without scoring during which Stanford scored 11 in a row to take a comfortable lead.

San Diego led by as many as nine in the first half but after making 12 of its first 26 shots missed 16 of the next 18 over the final 3:49 of the first half and first 7:44 of the second half. The Toreros shot 36.5 percent overall, making just 5 of 21 threes.

Stanford has held four straight opponents under 60 points and are allowing 57.7 per game. The Cardinal have allowed at least 70 points per game in their previous four seasons.

Stanford shot 43.4 percent from the field, including 8 of 21 from 3-point range.
