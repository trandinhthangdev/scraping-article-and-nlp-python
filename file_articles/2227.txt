Omar Yurtseven totaled career highs of 32 points and 17 rebounds and Georgetown stretched its winning streak to five games with a 99-71 rout of visiting Samford on Saturday afternoon in Washington D.C.

The Hoyas (9-3) remained unbeaten since dismissing James Akinjo and Josh LeBlanc from the team on Dec. 2. They reached 90 points for the third time this season and posted their fourth consecutive double-digit win.

Yurtseven helped Georgetown easily get its latest win by dominating while getting his sixth double-double of the season and 13th of his collegiate career that began at North Carolina State. He shot 15 of 21 the floor and surpassed his previous career high in points of 29 set Jan. 11, 2018, for North Carolina State against Clemson.

Mac McClung added 25 points on 10-of-19 shooting after being held to eight points in Tuesday's 26-point win over UMBC. Jamorko Pickett contributed 14 while Jahvon Blair chipped in 11 as Georgetown shot 48.7 percent, scored 48 points in the paint and 26 fast-break points while converting 18 layups and dunks.

Brandon Austin scored 26 points and Josh Sharkey added 24 but it was not enough as Samford (6-8) lost its third straight game. Samford shot 40.7 percent, allowed 25 points off 15 turnovers and lost for the fifth time in seven games while allowing at least 90 points for the sixth time.

Georgetown started sluggishly, missing eight of its first 11 shots, and trailed 9-8 with 15:22 remaining when Logan Padgett hit a 3-pointer. The Hoyas held Samford scoreless for the next 6:13 and scored 12 straight points for a 20-9 lead on three free throws by Blair with 11:48 remaining.

After Samford ended its drought on a basket by Austin that made it 20-11, the Hoyas ripped off a 20-7 run to get a 40-18 lead on a layup by Pickett with 3:47 remaining. Samford countered with a 13-4 run to end the half and Georgetown held a 44-31 lead after Sharkey hit a jumper with two seconds left.

Samford was within 44-34 when Austin hit a 3-pointer 16 seconds into the second half but Georgetown pulled away again, ripping off an 18-2 burst to take a 62-36 lead on a layup by Jagan Mosely with 16:06 remaining.
