Fire conditions are forecast to ease on Saturday giving fire fighters a chance to get on top of the Queensland blazes before conditions worsen on Sunday, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

All of the state has been issued a 'high' or 'very high' fire danger rating for Saturday, which is an improvement from Friday.

Some areas had 'severe' fire conditions on Friday morning, keeping fire fighters on their toes.

Residents in the regional town of Cainbable, west of the Gold Coast, were on alert all day Friday after being warned they needed to prepare to leave as the bushfire in the Lamington National Park threatened properties.

A heatwave which is forecast to move from the state's inland areas to the east is expected to increase the fire danger on Sunday for the central and southern regions.

The Darling Downs, Granite Belt, Central Highlands and Coalfields areas are forecast to have 'severe' fire danger warnings as the mercury rises.

Conditions look to improve early next week, with a drop in temperature bringing fire danger levels down in the worst affected areas.

Queensland's south west regions are forecast to have the lowest fire danger rating - low to moderate - on Christmas Eve.
