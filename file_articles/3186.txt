As NBA officials continue to mull the addition of an in-season tournament, they also are considering paying members of the winning team $1 million each.

That's according to a report Friday from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, who wrote the league hoped "an additional financial incentive would motivate players to treat a new tournament with a competitive fervor."

The proposed 30-team, in-season tournament is one of the innovations that commissioner Adam Silver has brought to the table for consideration in the league's 75th season in 2021-22.

Other potential changes include the reseeding of the final four playoff teams, regardless of conference, as well as play-in games for the season-ending playoffs.

The midseason tournament, based loosely on the European Champions League soccer model, would use regular-season divisional games to double as round-robin games to set up a separate playoff field. Those teams advancing would have a chance to play for the in-season title and the league presumably would be able to sell the broadcast package.

The league is discussing potential changes with broadcast partners and the players union.

Changes to the league schedule, including the formation of the in-season tournament, would need two-thirds (23 teams) approval of the NBA's Board of Governors when it meets in April, as well as approval from the players union.
