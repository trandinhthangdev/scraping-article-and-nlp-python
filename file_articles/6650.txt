The Jacksonville Jaguars fired executive vice president of football operations Tom Coughlin on Wednesday evening, a decision that owner Shad Khan announced while saying he initially planned to wait until after the season.

"I thank Tom for his efforts, not only over the past three years but for all he did from our very first season, 25 years ago, to put the Jacksonville Jaguars on the map," Khan said in a statement. "General Manager Dave Caldwell and Head Coach Doug Marrone will each report directly to me on an interim basis. My expectations, and those of our fans, for our final two games and the 2020 season are high."

The news comes two days after the NFL Players Association won a grievance against the Jaguars through an NFL arbiter, regarding whether the team had the right to fine players for not rehabbing at team facilities during the offseason. The NFLPA issued a lengthy statement condemning the Jaguars' practices and advising future free agents to be wary of the team.

Coughlin, 73, had held his current role with the Jaguars since 2017, helping the team reach the AFC Championship Game in his first season. He also served as the Jaguars' inaugural coach and posted a 68-60 record over eight seasons.

--Odell Beckham Jr. shot down the notion he wants out of Cleveland amid the Browns' disappointing season.

"I'm not going anywhere," Beckham told media members. "I'll be here. We'll figure this thing out. It's just too special to leave."

Beckham spoke 10 days after Fox Sports reported he told opposing players and coaches to "come get me" out of Cleveland. And that was after the receiver earlier had said, "no one knows what the future holds, like tomorrow."

--Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott rested his arm as the team prepares for its NFC East showdown against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Prescott is nursing a right shoulder injury sustained in the Cowboys' 44-21 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. His MRI after the game came back negative, per coach Jason Garrett.

"He just banged it up and it's hard for him to function right now," Garrett said on Wednesday, "so (I) don't want him throwing much in practice."

--New York Giants rookie quarterback Daniel Jones, who missed the past two games because of a high ankle sprain, took part in a full practice with the first unit.

That would put Jones on track to start Sunday at the Washington Redskins, sending veteran Eli Manning back to the sideline. Jones was limited in practice all last week before being ruled out.

Jones, the sixth pick in the 2019 draft, has completed 61.6 percent of his passes (228 of 370) for 2,374 yards, with 18 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

--The Oakland Raiders are placing Pro Bowl offensive tackle Trent Brown on injured reserve and plan to hold out running back Josh Jacobs in Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Chargers.

Coach Jon Gruden announced the decisions three days after the Raiders lost their fourth straight game to fall to 6-8.

Brown, who started 11 games at right tackle this season, missed the two previous games with a pectoral injury sustained in Oakland's 40-9 loss to Kansas City on Dec. 1. Jacobs has played with a fractured shoulder since Week 7, missing just one game, in Week 14.

--The New Orleans Saints continued to address their secondary by signing safety D.J. Swearinger to a contract, multiple media outlets reported.

The reported move comes two days after the Saints claimed cornerback Janoris Jenkins off waivers.

Swearinger will be joining his third team this season. He was released by Arizona on Sept. 30 after playing in its first four games of the campaign before signing with Oakland in November, only to be cut last week.

--New York Giants tight end Evan Engram revealed that he will undergo surgery on his injured right foot later in the week.

Engram has been sidelined since New York's 37-18 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Nov. 4. He was placed on injured reserve Tuesday.

--New York Jets safety Jamal Adams returned to practice and expects to play for the first time in three weeks on Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Adams, who was officially limited in practice as he returns from a high ankle sprain, told reporters the chances of him playing are "very high."

--Chicago Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan was placed on injured reserve for the second time in four seasons, the team announced.

Trevathan injured his elbow while tackling quarterback Jeff Driskel during the Bears' 20-13 victory over the Detroit Lions on Nov. 10.

--The Tampa Bay Buccaneers placed wide receiver Mike Evans and safety Jordan Whitehead on injured reserve on Wednesday.

Wide receiver Spencer Schnell was elevated from the practice squad to the active roster.
