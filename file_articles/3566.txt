Sydney Sixers captain Moises Henriques concedes his side got a little ahead of themselves in their calamitous Big Bash League loss to the Hobart Hurricanes.

Chasing just 130 for victory at Alice Springs on Friday, the Sixers suffered a collapse of 7-13 in 21 balls and were rolled for 104 in the second-last over.

The Hurricanes' young Afghan import Qais Ahmed starred with 4-12 from four overs of legspin and also pulled off a run-out.

Sydney were looking good at 1-48 in the power play but their innings fell in a heap on a tricky low and slow pitch at Traeger Park.

"I dont think they had too many (runs) on the board. It wasn't your typical T20 wicket but it was the same for both teams," Henriques told reporters.

"We may have got ahead of ourselves a little bit in that chase."

Henriques was Ahmad's first victim when he was caught in the deep off the 19-year-old for two.

"If we were to look back .. were those shots necessary at the time?," he said.

"It's something to learn from, especially considering we've been a very confident chasing team in the past. It was very manageable."

Josh Philippe hit 24 but couldn't replicate his efforts from Wednesday where an unbeaten 81 guided the Sixers to an eight-wicket win over Perth.

Jordan Silk and tailender Ben Manenti (both 22) gave Sydney a glimmer of hope with a 41-run ninth-wicket stand but by then the damage had been done.

"Maybe we were a bit too aggressive at times. Maybe got a little bit excited because of our chase the other night," Henriques said.

The Sixers are 1-1 to start the tournament and next face the Brisbane Heat at the SCG on Sunday night.
