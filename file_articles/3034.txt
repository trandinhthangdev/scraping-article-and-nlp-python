NEW YORK (AP) - Drita D´Avanzo of the reality TV series "Mob Wives" and her spouse have been arrested on weapons and drug charges.

D´Avanzo and her husband, reputed Colombo crime family associate Lee D´Avanza, were in court on Friday after executing a search warrant on Thursday evening at the couple's New York City home.

A criminal complaint says officers found two loaded firearms - one in a bedroom, the other in the kitchen - opioids and drug-dealing paraphernalia inside the residence on Staten Island. It says they also recovered a "large quantity" of marijuana in the basement.

D´Avanzo was among the relatives of mobsters featured on the VH1 series that ended in 2016 after a six-year run.

Prosecutors say D´Avanzo was released on $15,000 bail. A phone message was left with her lawyer.

The husband was denied bail. His attorney, James Froccarro, declined comment.
