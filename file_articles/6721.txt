Two same-sex couples complete with a baby and pet dog have been included in part of a new play-set by Kmart Australia.

Parents have the choice to buy a family with two mums, a family with two dads or a family with opposite sex couple parents as part of the $15 Anko family pack.

Orders for the new toy are also generated randomly online, meaning shoppers who order the product won't be able to choose which 'family' type they want, but will receive a random selection.

The website lists the product as suitable for ages 3+.

While the inclusive family set was largely praised on social media, with many praising Kmart for its decision to diversify its product offering since same-sex marriage was legalised in Australia two years ago.

'Glad that all children can finally buy a family set that represents themselves and their families. This is so amazing,' a commenter said.

However, some took issue with the fact all the couples were white.

'Be great if they were more racially diverse,' said comment, Yahoo reported.

'All white of course. No one of colour exists as a family according to Kmart,' another said on Twitter.
