This is the incredible moment a BMW 3 Series is transported sideways in the back of a van with its rear doors open.

The video, captured in the city of Radauti in north-east Romania, shows the white van travelling on a busy road.

Both of its rear doors are open and a silver BMW E46 is lodged in sideways, protruding at the back.

There are no ropes holding it in place, only the two rear doors preventing it from tumbling down on to the road.

The clip was posted on Facebook by Ruben Costea on December 10 with the caption 'Radauti 2019'.

It is not known if it was only the car's body being transported or if the engine and seats were still attached.

It appears the wheels and chassis are no longer part of the old BMW which makes the move slightly easier.

Despite the precarious method, it appears the car is firmly lodged in place during the journey.

But it has led viewers to ask how the driver succeeded in getting the car in the van in such a peculiar way and how they plan on removing it on the other side.

A BMW 3 Series is 14ft long which explains why it would not fit inside the back of the van.
