The competition watchdog will investigate the takeover of a Worcestershire-based aerospace group amid fears China could gain access to sensitive military equipment.

Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom has ordered the Competition and Markets Authority to probe an offer by a group called Aerostar to buy British firm Mettis Aerospace Limited over national security concerns.

The CMA must report back to the Business Secretary by March 17 about whether it thinks the takeover is a good idea.

Mettis makes parts such as propeller blades for military planes and helicopters and counts big-name firms such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, and BAE among its customers.

Aerostar is connected with Chinese group Ligeance Aerospace Technology, which is already facing a CMA probe over an attempt to buy British engineer Impcross on national security grounds.
