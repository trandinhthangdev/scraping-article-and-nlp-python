BEIJING, Dec 19 (Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry said it hoped United States and North Korea could proactively seek effective solutions to build trust and resolve disagreements, and to resume communication as soon as possible.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui met U.S. special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun in Beijing on Thursday, exchanging views on promoting the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, the ministry said in a statement on its website.

Biegun arrived in the Chinese capital after holding talks with officials in South Korea and Japan this week. (Reporting by Vincent Lee and Roxanne Liu in Beijing; Editing by Alison Williams)
