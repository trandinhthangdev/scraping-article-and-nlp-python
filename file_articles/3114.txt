It's the heartwarming tale of a shy little girl who returns a baby dragon to its mother – a beast feared by the rest of her village – and in so doing erodes fear and wins everyone over.

Now, with a new adaptation of Sir Michael Morpurgo's Mimi And The Mountain Dragon on Boxing Day, the author reveals he was inspired to write it by a trip to the Alps.

'I saw children cracking whips, ringing cowbells, banging drums, creating a cacophony of noise as they paraded through the village,' he recalls.

'I was told they were driving away wicked spirits, and so began my story.'

This animated version, which has no dialogue but uses an engaging classical music score, is based on illustrations by Emily Gravett.

'Putting anger and vulnerability and fear into drawings is my strength,' she says. 'This is a tale about overcoming your fears, it's a classic Christmas story.'

Mimi And The Mountain Dragon, Boxing Day, 3.20pm, BBC1.
