MANILA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - A Philippine court found top members of a political clan guilty on multiple counts of murder on Thursday over a mass killing a decade ago that included 32 journalists, in a case known as the "Maguindanao Massacre".

The judge in a Manila court found top members of the Ampatuan family accused of masterminding an attack on a rival election candidate's convoy guilty of killing 57 people in 2009 in the southern province of Maguindanao. The brazen attack was the country's single worst case of election violence. (Reporting by Martin Petty and Karen Lema Editing by Robert Birsel)
