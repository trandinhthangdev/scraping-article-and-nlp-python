Mason Mount's dad has had a sly dig at Jose Mourinho after Chelsea beat Tottenham 2-0 on Sunday.

The Tottenham boss criticised the Chelsea midfielder after the Blues' opening day defeat to Manchester United whilst Mourinho was working for Sky Sports.

Now Mount's dad, Tony has had a pop back posting a picture of Mourinho with the caption '2-0' and a 'zip it' emoji.

Speaking as a pundit for Sky Sports, Mourinho claimed: 'You look to the performance of Mason Mount, the performance of Tammy Abraham, you look to the performance even of [Andreas] Christensen and for matches of this dimension you need a little bit more'.

A stunned Lampard said after: 'He didn't like the performance of Mason Mount? Is that what he said? Did he? Wow.

'I don't have to be too concerned about what anyone else says, pundit-wise or anyone, they have to speak.'

Tony Mount would have enjoyed Sunday's win which saw Willian score twice at Tottenham.

Son Heung-min was sent off in a game which was marred by racist abuse aimed at Antonio Rudiger.
