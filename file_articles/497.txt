A man accused of keeping illegal chemical stockpiles across Melbourne has been charged.

Graham Leslie White, 58, is facing 55 charges relating to stockpiles kept at four warehouses in Epping and one at Campbellfield.

Authorities cleared more than six million litres of waste from the five stockpile sites after uncovering the breaches in January.

WorkSafe Victoria alleges White failed to take precautions to prevent fire or explosion of dangerous goods, or neglected to dispose of them safely.

He is also accused of failing to take reasonable precautions against fire or explosion, despite knowing it could endanger the health and safety of people, property or the environment.

Other charges relate to breaching regulations on signs, fire protection, spill containment and keeping a prescribed manifest.

The matter is expected before the Melbourne Magistrates Court in January.
