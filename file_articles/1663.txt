Sam Strahan, who played 17 tests mostly as the locking partner of All Blacks legend Colin Meads, has died aged 74.

Strahan's death at his home on Saturday was confirmed by the Manawatu Rugby Union, for which he played all of his domestic first class rugby.

Colin Meads formed an outstanding All Blacks locking partnership with his brother Stan until 1966 when Stan retired. The All Blacks selectors cast around for a replacement and lighted on the then 22-year-old Strahan who produced an outstanding lineout performance in a Ranfurly Shield challenge for Manawatu.

He made his test debut against Australia in 1967 and went on to play all four tests on the All Black's unbeaten tour to Britain that year, including the test against Scotland in which Meads was sent off.

Strahan also played the first three tests in New Zealand's series defeat in South Africa in 1970.

He would have been 75 on Christmas Day.
