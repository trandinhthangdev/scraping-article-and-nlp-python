Arsenal are considering making a move for Bayer Leverkusen forward Kevin Volland, according to Sky Sports.

The German international has 18 months remaining on his contract and the Gunners are eager to take advantage of a cut-price deal.

Volland usually plays through the centre but is versatile enough to be deployed on either flank if needed.

Arsenal scouts have watched the forward in recent matches and he is one of the names new manager Mikel Arteta will consider signing.

Arteta took his first training session on Sunday since becoming the new Arsenal boss last week.

The session seemed to mainly involve players who didn't feature in Arsenal's 0-0 draw with Everton, where Arteta was watching on from the stands alongside the club's hierarchy.

Arteta was animated as he delivered his first coaching session to the players after signing a three-and-a-half year deal at the Emirates.

Star players Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Pepe, Matteo Guendouzi and Mesut Ozil were all involved in training after not starting at Goodison Park.
