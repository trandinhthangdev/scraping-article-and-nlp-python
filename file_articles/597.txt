East Gippsland bushfires burning continuously since November 21 have prompted a forecast for smoky conditions in Melbourne and other parts of the state.

As flames continue blazing in the North East, East Gippsland and also in New South Wales, Environment Protection Authority Victoria expects southerly winds to bring hazardous air quality.

EPA has advised people who are sensitive to air pollution to avoid being outside in the smoke or dust.

While two 'Watch and Act' warnings remain active in southwest and southeastern Victoria, several other blazes continued burning statewide following days of record breaking temperatures.

'We have had more than 2,200 CFA deployments into New South Wales and Queensland since September and many more thousands of CFA members responding to fires back here in Victoria,' CFA chief officer Steve Warrington said.

'We are just days from Christmas when most Victorians are winding down and going on leave, but in Gippsland and many other areas of the state, CFA and other emergency service agencies continue to work in gruelling conditions.'

Mr Warrington will visit the East Gippsland fires on Monday as the final areas of Victoria - Moyne, Southern Grampians and Warrnambool - enter the Fire Danger Period.

With the addition of this three last areas, restrictions are in force statewide.

When a Fire Danger Period is declared, fires can't be lighted in open air without a permit or complying with certain requirements.

The Fire Danger Period is scheduled to finish in May 1.
