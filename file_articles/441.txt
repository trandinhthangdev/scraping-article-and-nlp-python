TRIBUTES FOR FORMER VICTORIAN PREMIER JOHN CAIN:

*"We are grateful John enjoyed good health and remained very active prior to his stroke. He is much loved and admired by his family and will be greatly missed," Cain family statement

*"John's leadership transformed Labor into a party that not only represented the interests of working people - but could deliver as well. No list can properly convey his immense contribution to our state," Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews

*"He was an honourable man. He was decent. He gave his all to public life. He's a great figure in Victoria, a great premier, a great Labor leader, and he will be sorely missed," Former Victorian Labor premier Steve Bracks

*"As a young activist and student in Melbourne, I was awed by Premier John Cain, a reforming giant of the Labor Party. My sense of deep respect and affection never lessened. What a life of achievement. He will be missed," former prime minister Julia Gillard

*"He lowered unemployment. He introduced social reform, such as land rights, which had waited far too long to be introduced in Victoria," federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese

*"Mr Cain played an important role in modernising the Victorian Labor party and maintained a statesmanlike dignity in his nearly 30 years of political retirement," Victorian Liberal leader Michael O'Brien

*"Very sorry to hear of John Cains death. Very committed Labor man and social justice advocate. As Premier of Victoria had strong views based on good values," Former Victorian Liberal premier Jeff Kennett

*"Rest in peace John Cain, a kind man who helped modernise Victorian Labor and led it to victory in 1982 after 27 years in the wilderness," federal Labor frontbencher Bill Shorten

*"John Cain was utterly devoted to Labor and public life, and the most decent politician imaginable," federal MP Andrew Giles

*"Three times election winner, he reframed Labor's mission as the reformist party for a modern Victoria," state Labor minister Martin Foley

*"Very sad to hear. He was an extraordinary man that never shied from telling me what he thought," state crossbencher Fiona Patten
