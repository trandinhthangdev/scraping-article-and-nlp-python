Hardworking Australians can maximise their annual leave in 2020 by following a few simple bank holiday hacks.

Those who want to holiday over Easter can get 16 days off by using just eight days leave.

In 2020, Easter Sunday falls on April 12.

That means if you take four days of leave from Monday April 6 to Thursday April 9 you will get 10 days off - from Saturday April 4 to Easter Monday April 13

With 16 days off in a row you have enough time to travel overseas for a proper break at Easter

MAXIMUM HOLIDAYS 16 DAYS IN A ROW - EASTER Take Monday April 6 to Thursday April 9, and Tuesday April 14 to Friday April 17 inclusive Leave days used: 8

9 DAYS IN A ROW - AUSTRALIA DAY Take Tuesday January 28 to Friday January 31 inclusive Leave days used: 4 5 DAYS IN A ROW - NEW YEAR'S DAY Take Thursday January 2 and Friday January 3 inclusive Leave days used: 2 Note: this only works for regular week-day workers who get weekends and public holidays off

Add in another four days of leave from Tuesday April 14 to Friday April 17 inclusive and you will extend your break to a whopping 16 days straight while using up just eight days of leave.

That's enough time for a proper overseas holiday.

Australia Day provides another holiday extension opportunity.

In 2020, January 26 falls on a Sunday, which means Monday is the observed day off.

Staff who take four days off from Tuesday January 28 to Friday January 31 will get a full nine days off in a row, including the weekends.

New Year's Day is another golden opportunity for more time off as it falls on a Wednesday.

That means if you take off Thursday January 2 and Friday January 3, the weekend will follow straight after and you get five days off in a row.
