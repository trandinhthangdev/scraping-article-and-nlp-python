Labor leader Anthony Albanese has demanded the government explain why almost 50 refugees and asylum seekers have been detained in a Melbourne hotel.

The men were on Manus Island before coming to Australia under the medevac laws but are facing an uncertain future after the health evacuation measures were repealed.

Mr Albanese said the refugees and asylum seekers being held in Melbourne's north showed the government's lack of transparency.

"They need to explain what these rather strange circumstances are of people being kept in a hotel in Melbourne without any information being given," he told reporters in Sydney on Thursday.

"This government continues to run into issues because they won't just be up front."

The Labor leader said there needed to be answers about why the men were being kept at the hotel and what the future held for them.

"What we have is a government that is addicted to secrecy and addicted to hiding from the public, and one that just isn't transparent."

More than 45 men are confined to the Mantra on Bell in Preston, with the floor they are on off limits to other guests and patrolled by private security guards.
