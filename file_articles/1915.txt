Tennessee point guard Lamonte Turner announced Saturday that he has opted for shoulder surgery that will end his Volunteers career -- and the declaration surprised even his coach.

"After he met with the media today, Lamonte and his family sat down with me and he informed me of his decision," coach Rick Barnes said after Tennessee beat Jacksonville State 75-53, giving Barnes his 700th win. "He gave everything he had for four and a half years, he earned his degree and he played a key role in establishing the culture of our program. We all love Lamonte and are saddened that he is unable to continue playing at this time. We'll continue to support him as he takes his next steps."

In his final game Saturday, Turner played 32 minutes, scoring eight points and adding 11 assists.

"I played my last game tonight as a Vol -- in a Vol uniform," Turner told reporters. "A lot of people know I have been battling an injury. We haven't known what it is or what is wrong or what is going on and stuff like that. As of like two weeks ago, we finally figured it out. I have thoracic outlet syndrome. It has been affecting my nerves and stuff like that. It explains my shot and all the stuff that I have been going through and battling. I decided to have surgery. I won't be playing anymore."

He did not say when he would have the surgery.

In 11 games this season, Turner averaged career highs in points (12.3) and assists (7.1). In 106 career games, he averaged 10.2 points per game.

He has battled numerous shoulder injuries throughout his time at Tennessee.

"I cried when I came back in the locker room just knowing that was my last time stepping out there," Turner said after the game. "I have cried plenty of times thinking about it, and I have cried plenty of times through this injury."
