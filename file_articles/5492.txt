Disgraced former NSW Labor minister Milton Orkopoulos will walk from Long Bay Correctional Centre after spending 11-and-a-half years behind bars for child sex offences.

The 62-year-old will be released at 10am on Friday after earlier in the month being granted parole despite him using drugs in jail earlier this year.

The former NSW Aboriginal affairs minister was jailed after he was convicted of 30 offences including supplying cannabis and heroin, sexual intercourse with a male between 10 and 18 years, and possessing child pornography.

He abused three male victims aged 15 to 20 after plying them with drugs and alcohol while serving as a Lake Macquarie City councillor and NSW MP between 1995 and 2006.

The State Parole Authority, chaired by Justice James Wood, granted him parole because it would enable him to access treatment and supervision he would not otherwise receive if he was released at the end of his sentence in October 2021.

"The only way in which he can have a supervised and assisted transition back into the community is via parole release," Justice Wood said.

"Refusal or deferral of parole is likely to increase any risk of institutionalisation."

Orkopoulos must abide by 11 strict parole conditions including that he wear an electronic ankle bracelet, not contact his victims, not be in the company of or contact anyone on social media under 16 years.

He is also banned from the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie areas.

Orkopoulos incurred four institutional misconduct charges while in prison - two for failing drug tests in December 2015 and February 2019 and two for receiving prohibited goods from a visitor in 2009 and 2013.

He failed a drug test earlier this year after testing positive to buprenorphine, an opioid used in the treatment of heroin and methadone dependence.
