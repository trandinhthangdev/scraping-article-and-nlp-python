Infielder Travis Shaw and the Toronto Blue Jays agreed to a one-year, $4 million contract, according to multiple reports on Sunday.

The deal reportedly also contains $675,000 in performance bonuses.

Shaw, 29, is expected to play first base but could give Vladimir Guerrero Jr. a rest at third base, too. First base is open with free agent Justin Smoak agreeing to a one-year, $5 million deal with Milwaukee last week.

In 2017, Shaw excelled for the Brewers, batting .273 with 31 home runs and 101 RBIs. He followed with another productive year in 2018, hitting 32 home runs with 86 RBIs and 23 doubles despite a .241 average.

But last season, he struggled at the plate, batting just .157 with seven homers and 16 RBIs in 86 games. He was shipped to Triple-A San Antonio, where he hit .286 with 12 homers and 33 RBIs in 42 games.
