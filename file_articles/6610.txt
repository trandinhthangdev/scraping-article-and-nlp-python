Will Scott Morrison discuss the Adani coal mine during his upcoming trip to India?

"We'll wait and see," his deputy Michael McCormack told reporters in Sydney on Thursday.

"The PM is going to have a number of talks with Indian counterpart (Narendra) Modi, he's going to be having talks with business leaders.

"We need to continue and enhance our trade negotiations with India and he'll be doing that and much more."

The prime minister will travel to India for several days in January, with security and business ties at the top of his agenda.
