Aamir Simms scored 18 points, and Clemson snapped a four-game losing streak with a 68-39 victory against visiting Jacksonville on Friday night.

Simms, a junior forward, made 7 of 8 shots from the floor. He is 12 of 15 on field-goal attempts over his past two games after scoring 21 points in a loss to South Carolina on Sunday.

Clemson (6-5) also got 15 points from Curran Scott.

Kevin Norman led Jacksonville (7-7) with 16 points, and DeAnthony McCallum scored 10.

Scott, a graduate transfer from Tulsa who entered the game averaging 6.6 points per game, posted his high point total at Clemson and just his third double-figure scoring game as a Tiger. Tevin Mack, a graduate transfer from Alabama, had 11 rebounds for Clemson.

Clemson built a 37-28 halftime lead, then took command with defense in the second half. The Tigers outscored Jacksonville 31-11 in the second half -- the fewest points allowed in the second half by a Brad Brownell-coached Clemson team.

The Dolphins made only 5 of 28 shots in the second half and scored only two points over the last 14:31 of the game.

Norman, a junior forward, scored Jacksonville's first 10 points of the game. Junior swingman Destin Barnes, who had five 3-pointers and scored 17 points in Jacksonville's win at Presbyterian on Wednesday, was held to six points on a pair of 3-pointers.

Clemson junior guard Clyde Trapp, who is coming off surgery for a torn ACL, returned to the lineup for the first time this season and scored four points. A starter last season, Trapp also had two assists in 12 minutes of playing time.

The Tigers wound up outshooting the Dolphins 43.9 percent to 25.5 percent from the floor.
