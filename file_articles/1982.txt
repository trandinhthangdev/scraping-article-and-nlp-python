Freshman forward Armando Bacot scored 15 points and North Carolina overcame a horrid start to the second half to defeat UCLA 74-64, snapping a four-game losing streak Saturday at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

Freshman Anthony Harris poured in 14 points off the bench, while Garrison Brooks, Brandon Robinson and freshman Jeremiah Francis all had 12 points for North Carolina. Bacot was the game's leading rebounder with 12.

The Tar Heels (7-5), playing their third game in a row without injured standout guard Cole Anthony, put together enough good stretches to pull out a victory. North Carolina had its longest losing streak since 2010, losing four games in December for the first time since 1999.

Jules Bernard's 16 points, Jaime Jaquez Jr.'s 14 points, Chris Smith's 12 points and Tyger Campbell's 10 points paced UCLA, which ended up with 22 turnovers and shot 4-for-21 on 3-point attempts.

UCLA (7-5) scored the first 12 points of the second half, which was full of early fouls, to pull within 36-35. But the Bruins never caught up despite having possessions with a chance to go ahead.

North Carolina used two timeouts in the first four minutes of the second half, leaving the Tar Heels with just one remaining.

After Campbell's jumper closed the gap to 46-41, the Tar Heels began to pull away. Leaky Black hit a shot, and then Harris scored the next five points.

Jalen Hill scored for UCLA before Harris bagged another 3-pointer. North Carolina's Jeremiah Francis hit four free throws in a 24-second span, and Bacot scored in the lane for a 63-49 lead with just more than four minutes to play.

North Carolina's 36-23 halftime lead was aided by 14 UCLA turnovers.

This was the first time in 13 all-time meetings that neither team was ranked nationally.

North Carolina also defeated UCLA last season in Las Vegas.

It was North Carolina's 15th consecutive victory against a team from the Pac-12 Conference.
