She's the Instagram model best known for her jaw-dropping curves and gym-toned figure.

And on Friday, Tammy Hembrow took to Instagram to share another sizzling video of herself lounging in the sun.

The 25-year-old mother-of-two showed off her incredible figure in a cleavage-baring blue bikini top as she posed poolside.

Tammy's blonde locks were left out and her makeup included a false set of lashes, as well as a nude colour on her plump pout.

She flaunted her washboard abs as she posed in front of the camera and flicked her hair from side to side.

'Mornings,' the Saski Collection founder captioned the eye-popping video alongside four blue butterfly emojis.
