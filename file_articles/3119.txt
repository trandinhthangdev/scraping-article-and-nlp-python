The Premier League are considering following the EFL by introducing fixed points deductions for clubs that breach financial fair play regulations.

Aston Villa are in danger of becoming the first club to be charged for exceeding the spending cap, as revealed by Sportsmail this week.

However, with no sanctions available at present, they could keep spending in a bid to avoid relegation and hope that even if found guilty they would be punished by a fine next season.

Premier League is considering introducing points deductions for clubs that breach FFP rules

Top-flight clubs are pushing for more clarity on how the Premier League intend to enforce their regulations in the belief it would provide a greater deterrent to overspending.

The EFL have brought in fixed tariffs of between three and 12 points, depending on the level of overspending, as well as the right to impose a further nine-point penalty for an aggravated breach.

The Villans spent a reported £133million on transfers last summer, with striker Wesley and defender Tyrone Mings both costing more than £20m each.

There were a further 10 players arriving on permanent deals, including Brazilian Douglas Luiz, wingers Trezeguet and Anwar El Ghazi, keeper Tom Heaton, defenders Bjorn Engels, Matt Targett and Ezri Konsa.
