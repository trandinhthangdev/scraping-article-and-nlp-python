Manuel Neuer insists he does not have a problem with Barcelona goalkeeper Marc ter Stegen as the pair battle to be Germany's No 1.

The duo have exchanged a petty war of words in recent times and their battle will continue over the next fortnight.

Ter Stegen has become frustrated with his lack of playing time with Germany, while Neuer hit back by claiming the Barcelona goalkeeper should solely focus on the national team.

'In principle, far too much was made of it,' Neuer told Kicker. 'I've never had a problem with Marc.

'We train for the national team together, but we don't call each other when he plays with Barcelona or I play with Bayern, and we wish ourselves the best of luck.

'We sit together at breakfast, have a normal conversation - as team-mates, not as competitors. Each of us tries to show our best performance for the team so that we can be successful.

'This is important because we play in a team. In football, it is not like in handball with clapping and hugging and you hold the next seven metres. Football is a different culture.'

Joachim Low split the playing time between the two in October, with Ter Stegen playing against Argentina in Dortmund and Neuer away at Estonia.
