MADRID, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The Spanish economy is expected to maintain its pace of growth in the fourth quarter at 0.4%, in line with the third quarter, the Bank of Spain said on Friday in a flash estimate.

The forecast confirms the central bank's previous estimate of around 0.4% growth for the last quarter of the year, announced earlier this week.

The Bank of Spain expects growth of 2.0% in total in 2019 and said the economy was likely to gradually slow down until 2022 due to lower consumption and weaker business investment. (Reporting by Emma Pinedo, editing by Ashifa Kassam)
