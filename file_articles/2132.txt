WASHINGTON (AP) - Brian Fobbs knocked down 24 points with 12 rebounds, his third career double-double, and made 5 of 6 free throws in the final 20 seconds as Towson narrowly beat Tulane 86-82 in overtime on Saturday.

Nicolas Timberlake scored a career-high 15 points and his block of a Tulane 3-pointer with 23 seconds remaining helped keep the Green Wave at bay. Fobbs shot 9 for 10 from the foul line, and Allen Betrand added 18 points for Towson (6-6).

Teshaun Hightower scored a career-high 31 points for the Green Wave (8-4), including a pair of free throws that made it an 84-82 game with eight seconds left. Tulane fouled Fobbs on the next inbounds and the Towson senior made both, putting the game out of reach.

Nic Thomas and Christion Thompson each added 19 points for Tulane.

There were five lead changes and six ties in a game that was a close battle throughout. Tulane buried 14 of 30 3-pointers but were outrebounded 44-28 as Towson owned a 28-14 edge on points in the paint.

Towson matches up against Northeastern at home next Saturday. Tulane takes on Memphis on the road next Monday.
