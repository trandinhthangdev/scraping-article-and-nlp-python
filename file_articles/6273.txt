STOCKHOLM, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank hiked its benchmark repo rate by a quarter point to 0.0% as expected on Thursday, defying a slowdown in the economy and global uncertainty to draw a line under five years with negative interest rates.

"Developments since the monetary policy meeting in October have on the whole been as the Riksbank expected," the central bank said in a statement.

"The Executive Board has therefore decided to raise the repo rate from -0.25 percent to zero percent, in line with the forecast from October."

The Riksbank was not the first to drop below zero when it cut to -0.10% in 2015, but it is the first to get rates into more normal territory. Rates are negative in the euro zone, Japan, Denmark, Switzerland and Hungary.
