With the wintry sea turning chillier by the day, the chance to hitch a lift proved too tempting for these lazy sea lions.

The gigantic mammals commandeered this small sailing boat in America's Pacific north-west – and proved so heavy the prow was almost submerged.

Their audacious hijack was captured on video and posted on Twitter.

Another video posted later showed a third sea lion trying to clamber aboard the craft in the Puget Sound near Olympia, Washington State, only to find there was no room on deck.

Californian sea lions weigh on average 660lb and can grow as long as eight feet.

The owner of the boat, who is unknown, will just have to weight and see if it has survived the animals' visit.
