Chelsea's rising star Mason Mount has revealed the advice he recieved from his dad that helped propel him from the academy into the first-team.

Mount is enjoying a brilliant full-debut campaign at Stamford Bridge after excelling out on loan at Championship side Derby County last season.

The 20-year-old's performances for Chelsea have seen him win his first England caps this term too.

Mason Mount has revealed the advice his dad gave him in order to stand out from other players

Mount says his dad told him from an early age to work on the defensive side of his game

Despite being a playmaker, Mount hasn't shirked his defensive duties as with high workrate and pressing - something that manager Frank Lampard is demanding from his squad.

And reflecting on those traits that he posseses, Mount reflects on a conversation with his dad when he was trying to make a name in the academy.

'My dad always said when I was younger that you can't just be a luxury No 10 because you see so many players like that in academy football,' he told the club's official website.

The 20-year-old midfielder has five goals in 25 appearances for the Blues this season

'You see so many players who want to get on the ball, do all the good stuff, but never want to track back, work hard or do the defensive side.

'You see that so much and he said to me that you need to do the other side of the game too, so that was always in my head.'

Mount, who has five goals in 25 appearances for the Blues this season, will be hoping to continue his fine form on Sunday afternoon when Chelsea travel to bitter rivals Tottenham in the Premier League.
