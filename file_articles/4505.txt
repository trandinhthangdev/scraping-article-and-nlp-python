Westpac has added high-profile business leaders Dr Ziggy Switkowski and Dr Kerry Schott to an independent panel it has commissioned to review its child exploitation and money laundering scandal.

The pair - who will be joined by a third panel member at a later date - will provide the bank with recommendations on risk and accountability as it scrambles to salvage its reputation following an alleged 23 million breaches of money laundering laws.

The AUSTRAC allegations have already claimed the scalp of Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer - who has been replaced on an interim basis by chief financial officer Peter King - while chairman Lindsay Maxsted will resign in the first half of 2020.

Mr Maxsted said on Friday Dr Switkowski and Dr Schott would help the bank "raise standards and fix any gaps in Westpac's financial crime-related processes".

The bank has also named IBM financial firm Promontory to the review into accountability.

Dr Switkowski is Chancellor of RMIT University, chairman of NBN Co and a director of Tabcorp Holdings, while Dr Schott is chair of the Energy Security Board and a Director of NBN.

She is also a member of the advisory board for City and SouthEast Light Rail.

Friday's announcement follows a move by APRA this week to increase Westpac's capital requirements by $500 million as it too probes the events that led up to, and followed, the alleged scandal - including a failure to properly monitor payments potentially linked to child sex offences in Southeast Asia.
