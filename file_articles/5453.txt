Queen Victoria's husband Albert introduced the Britain to the Christmas tree in 1841

Queen Victoria's husband Albert introduced the Britain to the Christmas tree in 1841 and in 1856 President Franklin Pierce followed suit by putting one up at the White House.

Known at the time as a Teutonic tannenbaum, by the 1870s they became popular in the United States.

Johnson hired Thomas Edison in 1871 and the light bulb was invented in 1879.

The next year a tree was displayed in New York's Washington Square Park but until then, they were lit up with hazardous candles.

Two years later Johnson used Edison's patent to string together the first set of colorful decorations in 1882.

Johnson put on a display of 80 red, white and blue bulbs outside his parlor at 136 East 36th Street in New York City, the tradition caught on and the presentation increased to 120 bulbs in brass sockets over the next two years.

The tradition went countrywide after in 1894 when President Cleveland put electric lights on the White House tree.

But back in 1990 a string of 16 flame-shaped bulbs the size of shot glasses sold for $12 – equivalent to about $350 in today's money – according to the Smithsonian. By 1914 however, a 16-foot string cost just $1.75.

James Newburn, from Nashville, Tenessee, says: 'Our family loves celebrating Christmas but now it will always be extra-special for us because we now know my great-great-grandfather is the man who invented the Christmas tree light.'
