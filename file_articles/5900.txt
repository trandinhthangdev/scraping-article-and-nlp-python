LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Britain's government will streamline how foreign funds can be sold to UK consumers after Brexit to help maintain its role as a major asset management centre.

Setting out its new legislative agenda in the Queen's Speech on Thursday, the government said it will simplify the process that allows overseas investment funds to be sold in the UK "to maintain our position as a centre of asset management and provide more choice for UK consumers".

Asset managers in Britain collectively manage over 7.7 trillion pounds ($10.1 trillion) for customers in Britain and around the world in centres including Dublin and Luxembourg.

UK-based portfolio managers account for about 36% of managers of Irish domiciled funds.
