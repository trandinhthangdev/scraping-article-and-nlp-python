Brooklyn Nets guard David Nwaba underwent successful surgery to repair a ruptured right Achilles tendon, the team announced Friday.

The procedure was performed by Dr. Martin O'Malley at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.

Nwaba, who will miss the remainder of the season, sustained the injury during Brooklyn's 118-105 setback at San Antonio on Thursday.

The 26-year-old is averaging 5.2 points and 2.3 rebounds in 20 games this season, his first with the Nets.

Nwaba is averaging 6.9 points and 3.7 rebounds in 161 career games with the Los Angeles Lakers, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers and Nets.
