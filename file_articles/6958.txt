Bayern Munich's Joshua Zirkzee and Serge Gnabry scored stoppage-time goals to give the Bundesliga champions a 3-1 win at Freiburg on Wednesday.

Robert Lewandowski opened the scoring for the German giants to continue his streak and secure an incredible 30th goal of the season before Christmas Day.

Bayern, who moved up to third in the table, got off to a strong start, hitting the post through Thomas Mueller before Lewandowski gave them the lead.

Freiburg, however, gradually gained control of the midfield, attacking with greater ease as the Bavarians were punished once more for their complacency.

Vincenzo Grifo volleyed in to level on the hour, completing a superb attacking move from the hosts, who missed several more scoring chances as the Bayern defence looked shaky.

Late substitute Zirkzee, the 18-year-old Dutch youth international, then slipped into the box and slotted in from close range before Gnabry added another.
