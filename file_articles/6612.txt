New Zealand have abandoned the opening day of their warm-up game ahead of the second Test against Australia because of sweltering conditions forecast for Melbourne.

Team management cancelled Friday's play on player welfare grounds because of a predicted maximum temperature ranging from 43C to 45C.

The match against a Victoria XI at Scotch College, scheduled for Friday and Sunday, will become a one-day first class match.

Coach Gary Stead confirmed the tourists will rest on Friday, train at the MCG on Saturday morning, before batting first in the reduced match.

'If it's going to be that hot, I'm not sure we're going to get too much out of it,' Stead said on Thursday.

'And there's just the danger element as well.'

A week out from the Boxing Day Test, Stead said the rest would be timely for a team still recovering the stifling heat of the first Test in Perth, albeit that it finished in defeat inside four days.

'It's hard to underestimate the effect that Perth had on us,' Stead said.

'We were in 40C temperatures every day. The travel back from Perth to Melbourne's pretty gruelling as well, and guys are still struggling to get their sleep patterns right.

'Having the extra day shouldn't do any harm to us.'

Stead remained highly confident key quick Trent Boult would be fit for the MCG, having sat out the Optus Stadium Test with an intercostal muscle injury.

Boult bowled with few problems at a training session on Wednesday.

'He looked somewhere near back to his best and was really confident running in,' Stead said.

'So that was pleasing to see and he's certainly on track to be available for the MCG Test.'
