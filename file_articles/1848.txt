The CDC shares that the increased activity is mostly a result of the influenza B/Victoria viruses, which they added was unusual for this time of the year.

After that particular strain of the virus, the A(H1N1) virus is the next most common and is increasing in proportion relative to other influenza viruses in some areas.

As of December 20, the CDC reports that there are 19 states that are experiencing high levels of flu activity. Puerto Rico is also included as having high activity.
