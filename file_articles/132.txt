PARIS, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Minor scuffles broke out on Monday between French protesters and police at Paris' Gare de Lyon station, as a nationwide strike against plans by President Emmanuel Macron to change the country's pension system dragged on into a 19th day.

French TV station BFM showed pictures of riot police scuffling with a group of about 30 protesters at the Gare de Lyon, which is one of the capital's busiest stations and is often used to travel to skiing resorts near the Alps.

The protesters let off flares and fireworks, with the smoke drifting down into the station concourse.

Two weeks of nationwide industrial action against Macron's pension reform, which would scrap special pensions for many public sector staff and make people work to 64 to draw a full pension, have crippled France's transport network.

France's oil sector workers are also expected to vote in favour of shutting down oil refineries, as part of the protest. (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Alison Williams)
