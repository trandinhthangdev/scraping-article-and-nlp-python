An alleged Rebels bikie has been charged after police seized explosives, fireworks, knives, firearms and more than 1000 rounds of ammunition on the NSW Central Coast.

Police allege they uncovered the haul when they searched a home at Mangrove Mountain on Wednesday morning.

Officers allegedly found two firearms, three knives, knuckle dusters, handcuffs, an extendable baton, a PVC air cannon, fireworks, explosives and ammunition. They also seized some cannabis and methamphetamine.

A 42-year-old man, alleged to be a Rebels outlaw motorcycle gang member, was charged with nine offences including possessing or using a prohibited weapon without permission, possessing an unregistered firearm and possessing a prohibited drug.

Police say he faced Gosford Local Court on Thursday where he was granted strict bail to appear again in January.
