They may be small but it seems that sausage dogs have a big fanbase.

The Kennel Club says that dachshund puppy registrations have jumped 112 per cent in just five years, from 4,887 in 2013 to 10,377 last year.

The most popular variety is the miniature smooth-haired – numbers grew from 2,871 to 7,008 during that period, followed by the miniature long-haired, up from 789 to 1,117.

The dachshund is still behind the French bulldog, the most popular dog by number of puppy registrations. Nearly 37,000 French bulldog puppies were registered last year.
