Just a day after celebrating her son's birthday at the beach, Michelle Bridges got back down to business in Sydney on Friday.

The mother-of-one was spotted running errands with her newly-turned four-year-old son Axel, who she shares with her partner of six years, Steve 'Commando' Willis, 43.

Holding his hand as they crossed the road together, little Axel trailed slightly behind his fitness trainer mum, 49.

Meanwhile, Axel looked sweet in a pair of blue denim shorts and a blue and white T-shirt.

They were seen entering a gym together, with Michelle flashing a quick smile before disappearing inside.

On Thursday, she paid tribute to her little boy on Instagram, revealing they had spent his fourth birthday at the beach.

Showing off her toned physique in a black patterned bikini, the mum-of-one gave her son a peck on the lips as she sat on the sand.

Dressed in a rash shirt and a hat, Axel leaned towards his mother for the kiss, a slick of zinc visible across his nose and cheeks.

'My heart skipped a beat... and just like that, he was 4... Happy birthday my one #beachbirthday goodbye my little toddler...' she wrote on Instagram, adding a series of celebratory emojis.
