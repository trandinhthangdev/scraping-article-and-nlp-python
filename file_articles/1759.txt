Boston College's Jairus Hamilton had 18 points and eight rebounds and the Eagles rallied from double-digit deficits in both halves to defeat California 64-60 in a nonconference game on Saturday in San Francisco.

The game was part of the Al Attles Classic, a four-game day-long tournament hosted by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame at the recently opened Chase Center.

The Golden Bears (6-6) were led by Matt Bradley's 21 points and nine rebounds. He was the only Cal player to score in double figures.

A 3-pointer by Jairus Hamilton put Boston College (8-5) ahead 61-58 with 1:35 left in regulation. After a California timeout, Paris Austin made a jump shot in the lane to cut the lead to 61-60.

The teams traded turnovers before Jairus Hamilton missed a shot in the lane. Derryck Thornton was fouled on the rebound attempt and he made both free throws to give the Eagles a 63-60 lead with 36 seconds left.

California called a timeout with 28.6 seconds remaining before Kareem South missed a 3-pointer. Jay Heath was fouled with four seconds remaining and he made one of two free throw attempts to seal the win for the Eagles.

Jared Hamilton -- the older brother of Jairus -- and Julian Rishwain each had 12 points for Boston College and Thornton had 10 points.

Both teams came out shooting cold in the first half, especially from 3-point range. They both were 1 of 9 from 3-point range as California led 29-26 at halftime.

Cal was unable to sustain its 13-point lead in the first half, allowing Boston College to score 10 unanswered points to cut the lead to 25-22 with 2:33 remaining until halftime.

A 10-2 spurt by the Golden Bears allowed them to take a 48-37 lead with 11:12 left in regulation.

Boston College rallied back to take a 56-52 lead with 5:09 remaining on a 17-2 run that that included Rishwain making two 3-pointers, hitting another jumper and making two free throws. Mitchell also converted a 3-point and made a jump shot in the rally.

California missed five shots and committed four turnovers during that stretch in which the Golden Bears went 5:18 without scoring.

Cal shot 43.4 percent from the field, and the Eagles shot 41.3.
