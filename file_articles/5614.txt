At one point, the vehicle passes a police officer on the roadside who does not seem to pay the futuristic car any mind.

The video was accompanied with the message: 'Tesla in Khimki!'

It is not known who adapted the car and which materials were used.

The Cybertruck is an electric battery-powered light commercial vehicle in development by Tesla.

Three models have been announced, with range estimates of 250 to 500 miles and an estimated 0 to 60 mph time of between 2.9 and 6.5 seconds, depending on the model.

But its launch last month proved to be an embarrassment for Elon Musk after he smashed one of its 'shatterproof' windows during a demonstration.
