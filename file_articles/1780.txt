Police have released CCTV images of three men they wish to speak to in connection with an attack on two officers.

A male police officer was punched in the head and knocked unconscious and a female colleague was dragged to the floor and stamped on as they intervened in a fight near a pub in Greater Manchester.

The officers were responding to another call when they saw a large group of men fighting in Long Street, Middleton, at 2.35am on Saturday.

The attack followed a night nicknamed Mad Friday or Black Eye Friday – the last Friday before Christmas which is often busier than usual for emergency services due to the number of revellers on the streets.

Greater Manchester Police said a number of men involved in the disorder had been ejected from Infinity nightclub on Long Street a few minutes earlier.

It has released CCTV of three men it wishes to speak to in connection with the attack, and urged witnesses to come forward.
