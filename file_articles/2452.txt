A Bali tourist warned other travelers to be wary of tick bites in a Facebook post on Saturday

The tourist described how the parasite had left him feeling ill for weeks.

He said: 'One month later I still feel s***house.'

The man also noted the dangers that ticks can pose and said: 'They carry Lyme disease so I'm told.'

Lyme disease is an illness caused by bacteria that ticks carry and can result in a rash and flu-like symptoms.

Commenters were quick to point out that Lyme disease can have serious consequences.

One responder warned: 'My brother in law is in a wheelchair with brain damage due to late diagnosis from Lyme disease... take it very seriously.'

Another commented: 'Mate hope you're getting serious medical advice!'

After receiving a number of concerned comments the tick victim realised that his bite might need medical attention.

'I better get to the doctors,' he said.
