A Bronx man asked his mother to hire a hitman to kill his love rival who he had already shot five times in the back, filings at the Bronx District Attorney's office show.

Candido Lizarro, 25, left a 20-year-old man with a damaged spine and in hospital after shooting him on the ground floor of an apartment building in West Farms, New York.

Fearing trial, Lizarro fled the state and asked his mother Annette Spann, 45, to find a hitman to kill his victim before the man could recover and testify.

When Spann started searching she allegedly accidentally put her son in touch with a police officer posing as a hitman, who Lizarro told 'I need this done man' and 'If it wasn't for this n*****, I wouldn't be in the jam right now', reported the New York Daily News.

Lizarro is being held after he was indicted on charges of attempted murder, assault, conspiracy and criminal solicitation. Spann is being held on charges of conspiracy and criminal solicitation.

The pair allegedly began conspiring after the victim was shot in the block owned by the city Housing Authority in September this year.

Two days later Lizarro started messaging a 'hitman' his mother had put him in touch with and on November 12 the three did a video call where Spann counted out the $1,000 promised payment, according to prosecutors.

Spann was arraigned yesterday and bail was set at $150,000 bond or $50,000 cash, reported the New York Post.

Lizarro was arraigned last Friday and remanded in custody. The pair are due back in court on February 19 next year.
