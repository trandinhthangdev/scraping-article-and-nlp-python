Those worst-hit by a devastating bushfire in the Adelaide Hills have been offered immediate financial assistance.

Hardship payments of $280 for each adult and up to $700 for each family are being jointly funded by the South Australian and federal governments.

Federal Natural Disaster and Emergency Management Minister David Littleproud said the support would put cash in the pockets of those most in need.

"These hardship payments are to help meet immediate needs such as food, clothing and medicine," he said.

"This is to help give dignity to people in hardship because of the fires.

"Further assistance will be made available once we get a clearer picture of damages on the ground."

A number of houses and other structures have been destroyed in the blaze which has burnt through more than 10,000 hectares of scrubland.

An emergency warning remained in place for the fire on Friday night with the towns of Cudlee Creek, Mount Torrens, Harrogate, Gumeracha, Lobethal and Woodside under immediate threat.

South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said the state and federal governments were standing "shoulder to shoulder with the community at this tough time".
