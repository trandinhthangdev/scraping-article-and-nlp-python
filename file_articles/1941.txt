The wife of the Bank of England’s new governor has spoken of her pride at his appointment.

When Andrew Bailey, 60, was named as the successor to Mark Carney on Friday, Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey, 58, a professor in political science at the London School of Economics (LSE) tweeted: ‘I am incredibly proud!’

The pair have been married for 30 years and are on their way to spend Christmas in their house in Schonhardt-Bailey’s home state of Idaho.

The couple also have a three-bedroom house in Beckenham, South-East London, bought in the early 1990s. But Bailey, the head of the Financial Conduct Authority is not known for conspicuous consumption: he drives a 15-year-old Volvo.

Bailey, who left the Bank in 2016, will return in mid-March. The Treasury is now on the hunt for a new FCA boss.
