A man wearing a clown mask pointed a replica pistol at a motorist in Sydney when their vehicles were stopped at traffic lights, NSW Police say.

Police allege a 24-year-old man - who's now behind bars - was a passenger in a truck when he pointed the fake pistol at the driver of an adjacent car on Thursday morning in Eastern Creek.

Officers subsequently stopped the truck on the M4 in Merrylands and found the 24-year-old with a clown mask and replica pistol.

The man was arrested and charged with possessing a firearm, being armed with intent and intimidation.

He's due to face Fairfield Local Court later on Friday.
