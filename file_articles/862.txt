WHAT TO DO

To tone and tighten the skin around your cleavage, try high plank hand walks, says celebrity personal trainer Nadya Fairweather (u-shape.co.uk).

Start in a high plank position with your hands lined up under your shoulders. You need to have a nice straight body, so engage your core and squeeze your bottom, holding your feet and legs tight together.

Now walk your hands out to the sides, nice and wide, then back in, out wide, back in. Be sure to breathe throughout. As well as helping with chest and arm strength, it also uses your core, bottom, and leg muscles.

WHAT TO EAT

For a defined cleavage, nutritionist Shona Wilkinson (shonawilkinson.com) recommends the following:

Red kidney beans are a great source of fibre and protein. Simply buy a can of red kidney beans and add them to stews and casseroles.

As well as containing omega-3 essential fatty acids, which are beneficial for skin, salmon contains a substance known as astaxanthin. This is a carotenoid which helps improve skin elasticity to prevent fine lines forming.

Tomatoes contain a nutrient called lycopene which helps with good skin health and protects from sun damage. They actually release more lycopene when cooked rather than raw.
