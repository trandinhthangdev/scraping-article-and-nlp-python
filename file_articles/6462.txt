Parts of Tasmania are set to reach temperatures about 16C above the state average on Friday as extreme heat gripping mainland Australia spreads south.

The mercury is expected to be at its hottest in the Derwent Valley at 36C, while Hobart is forecast to hit 33C.

Low humidity and dry winds have prompted a 24-hour total fire ban for the state's south from 2am on Friday.

"We're expecting it to be a fairly mild start to the day and build into the late afternoon and evening," Bureau of Meteorology's Simon Louis said.

"We're getting that heat that's coming down from the mainland."

Very high fire conditions are expected in the south, while there is a risk of dry lightning in the north and west.

A cool front is expected to cross the state on Friday night, which will drop maximum temperatures into the low 20s heading into Christmas.

Tasmania's average maximum for December is 20.4C.
