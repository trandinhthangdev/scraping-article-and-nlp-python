It's been a rough week for Skye. On Sunday night, she rushed her 11-month-old son Forest to hospital after he started having a febrile convulsion.

Skye found him in his room 'jolting' in his crib, with a high temperature.

'I thought my child was going to die, I thought he was going to be left brain damaged,' Skye announced on Instagram on Wednesday.
