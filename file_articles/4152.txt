Incoming Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta will face a big headache in the left back position after Sead Kolasinac joined Kieran Tierney on the injury list.

It has been confirmed by Arsenal that Kolasinac will not return to full training until January after being forced off with an ankle ligament injury in the 3-0 home defeat against Manchester City.

Tierney has already been ruled out until March after dislocating his right shoulder against West Ham at the London Stadium.

Arsenal are set to be without a first-team left back during the hectic festive period, in which they face Everton, Bournemouth and top four rivals Chelsea and Manchester United.

It will come as a huge blow to Arsenal and Arteta, who might be forced to play 18-year-old Bukayo Saka at left back until Kolasinac returns.

Saka, who has hugely impressed this season since breaking into the first-team, replaced Kolasinac after 40 minutes at the Emirates against City last weekend.
