An exhausted kangaroo was spotted cooling down in a backyard pool on a 42C day.

Resident Sharon Grady filmed the kangaroo as it stood in her pool in Merriwa, in the Upper Hunter region of NSW, on Saturday.

The region was devastated by a bushfire earlier this month, as a blaze southwest of the town in the Goulburn Rivers National Park raged out of control.

"If you are in the area southwest of Merriwa and you are not prepared, leave now towards Merriwa,' the RFS tweeted on December 1.

The temperature hit 42C on Saturday in Merriwa, after a week where the mercury didn't dip below 35 once.

Local radio station 98.1 Power FM shared the footage of the kangaroo, writing: 'In yesterday’s extreme heat, this roo found a pool at Merriwa to cool down in!'

'Only in Australia.'

The video, which garnered over 3,000 shares, shows the kangaroo in shallow water appearing to nibble on something while flapping its ears.

'Bless him. Just let him have the pool. The heat, fires n weather has all become too much,' one viewer wrote.

'We have had roos doing the same in our dam....surprised me when we first seen one jump in the water,' another added.

'Drought and fires have played havoc with their environment not to mention mankind. Glad to see this fella found somewhere to cool off,' a third replied.

Kangaroos are fast moving and can typically get ahead of a normal bushfire however many have been killed after being surrounded by more than one blaze in recent months.

Australia Walkabout Wildlife Park, 60km north of Sydney, has been inundated with hundreds of injured animals including kangaroos and wombats.
