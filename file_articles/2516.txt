Frank Lampard has called for control from his Chelsea stars in Sunday's derby clash at Tottenham.

Blues boss Lampard continues to challenge his team to show more fight, but has warned them not to overstep the mark at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Chelsea slumped to a fourth loss in five Premier League games in last weekend's 1-0 reverse to injury-hit Bournemouth and Lampard knows another defeat will see the Blues switch places with Spurs.

Former England midfielder Lampard wants Chelsea to be more daring to hit back to form, but also admitted the derby intensity can be tough to negotiate.

Asked if he would fear passion spilling over, Lampard said: 'We hope it doesn't. That's what happens when a game is so hot and the feeling is so big. But control that side of it.

'As long as it's not us instigating things across the line. Being competitive? Show it.'

Now the Chelsea manager, the 41-year-old expects no repeat this weekend - but accepted derby days require different levels of mental fortitude from players.

Lampard challenged Chelsea to show 'balls' in the wake of that Bournemouth blow, and will not shy away from that just because of the added pressure of local rivalry.

'There will always be a question of a player in a team,' said Lampard. 'Courage and bravery come in different ways.

'Against Bournemouth they needed to find a pass to be brave. Tottenham will be different: courage will be the atmosphere, the feeling, the physical nature of a Jose Mourinho team. Can we fight against them? It's a different kind of courage.'
