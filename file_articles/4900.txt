Carlo Ancelotti's shock appointment as Everton manager may pave the way for Zlatan Ibrahimovic to complete a stunning move to Goodison Park, according to The Telegraph.

The Italian manager will be in the stands as Everton play against Arsenal on Saturday ahead of his confirmation as boss in an impressive coup for the club.

Should Ancelotti take over, Ibrahimovic is open to a reunion with his former Paris Saint-Germain coach, it has been claimed.

Together the pair won the 2013 Ligue 1 title before Ancelotti's departure and the Italian had considered taking the striker to Napoli before his sacking.

Ibrahimovic, now 38, is still hunting for a new team after leaving MLS side LA Galaxy at the end of November.

A return to former club Manchester United has been ruled out, while AC Milan are also unlikely to sanction a move for their ex-hitman.

Everton are in the hunt for more reinforcements up top, with the club keen to ease the burden on Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

Cenk Tosun may leave the club in January after failing to impress, while Ibrahimovic may also help young striker Moise Kean integrate better into the team after a difficult start.

Everton consider appointing Ancelotti, a three-time Champions League winner, a game-changer and he will be rewarded with a long-term contract with his son Davide as assistant.
