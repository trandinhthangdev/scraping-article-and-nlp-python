Lyon are reportedly keen to sign out-of-favour Atletico Madrid forward Thomas Lemar.

The Frenchman has struggled since his £51m (€60m) move from Monaco in the summer of 2018, and is yet to score or record an assist this season.

However, his underwhelming spell in Spain could come to an end with Lyon prepared to offer Lemar a route back to his homeland, according to French outlet L'Equipe.

The report details that Atletico manager Diego Simeone is willing to cut his losses on the player and reinvest the money elsewhere.

Lemar, who was linked with a move to Arsenal and Liverpool before he signed for Atletico, has made 61 appearances since his big-money move but has only scored three times.

The 24-year-old is no longer a regular in the starting XI, but did start Atletico's last game - a 2-0 win at home to Osasuna on Saturday.
