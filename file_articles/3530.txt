The governing body could impose a limit on players' exposure to heading balls

FA will review whether to restrict the coaching of heading footballs at all levels

The FA will review whether to restrict the coaching of heading footballs at all levels, in light of research that confirms a link between football and dementia.

The governing body could impose a limit on players' exposure to heading balls to protect future generations of footballers.

The FA's head of medicine, Dr Charlotte Cowie, has also suggested that improvements be made to the pitchside treatment of concussion.

'It is imperative that football now does everything it can to further understand what caused this increased risk and what can be done to ensure that future generations of footballers are protected,' Dr Cowie said on Friday.

'We are as committed as ever to taking important steps to improve the game and to explore new areas of research.

'The FA's independently chaired research taskforce has instigated a review of possible changes to heading coaching and training at all levels to decrease overall exposure to heading without compromising technique.

'They have also suggested improvements to the management of concussion. While the risk shown in the field study is not understood at this stage, these are potentially important preventive measures.'

Sportsmail columnist Chris Sutton has highlighted the need for more to be done by the authorities.
