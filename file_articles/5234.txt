A man who allegedly relieved himself on the Anzac memorial in Sydney's CBD has been charged.

Police say he is the second man to be arrested for that particular offence this month.

The 23-year-old was nabbed by officers after he allegedly urinated on the western corner of the memorial building in Hyde Park just before 11pm on Thursday.

He is due to face the Downing Centre Local Court on January 22 charged with committing an offensive act in or on a war memorial.
