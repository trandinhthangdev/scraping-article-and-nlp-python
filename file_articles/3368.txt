Master Debonair was cut to 20-1 by the sponsors for the Sky Bet Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival in March after galloping his rivals into the ground in the Supreme Trial Novices' Hurdle at Ascot on Friday.

Jockey Robbie Power made all the running on the Colin Tizzard-trained gelding to draw eight lengths clear of runner-up Ribble Valley.

Master Debonair, a useful horse in National Hunt Flat races last season, has shown improved form after forcing tactics were adopted with him.

Tizzard said: 'He will have one more run and then go for the Supreme. There has been talk about running him in a handicap but I would love to keep him in novices this season and keep him fresh for Cheltenham, Aintree and Punchestown.'

The win strengthens the hand of Tizzard in the novice hurdle division.

He also trains Fiddlerontheroof, a possible for the Grade One Tolworth Hurdle on the first Saturday in January, and The Big Breakaway, a leading contender for the Ballymore Novices' Hurdle.
