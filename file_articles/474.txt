Freshman forward Jaden McDaniels scored a career-high 22 points as No. 22 Washington defeated Ball State 85-64 Sunday night in the opening round of the Diamond Head Classic in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The Huskies (9-2) will face the winner of Sunday's late game between host Hawaii and UTEP in the tournament semifinals Monday night.

Sophomore point guard Quade Green, a transfer from Kentucky, matched his career-high with 21 points and added a game-high six assists. Green was 7 for 8 from the field, including 4 of 5 from 3-point range.

Freshman forward Isaiah Stewart, who like McDaniels and Green was a McDonald's All-American in high school, added 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Huskies.

Washington has won seven of its past eight games, the lone defeat an 83-76 decision against No. 2 Gonzaga.

Senior forward Tahjai Teague led Ball State (6-5) with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Guards Ishmael El-Amin and Jarron Coleman added 13 and 11 points, respectively.

McDaniels, Green and Stewart all reached double-digits in the first half as the Huskies took a 51-40 lead.

Washington used an 11-2 run to take a 28-20 lead midway through the first half, sparked by a McDaniels 3-pointer and followed by back-to-back treys by Green and two free throws by Stewart.

Ball State scored the first six points of the second half and nine of the first 10 to pull within 52-49. Washington then went on an 8-0 run to regain a double-digit advantage.

Washington shot 56.4 percent from the field (31 of 55), including 11 of 24 from beyond the arc. Ball State shot 38.6 percent (22 of 57) and was 7 for 24 from long range.
