Jermaine Samuels hit the game-winning 3-pointer with 20.5 seconds remaining to lift No. 18 Villanova past No. 1 Kansas 56-55 on Saturday in Philadelphia.

Kansas became the fifth No. 1 team this season to be beaten, joining Michigan State, Kentucky, Duke and Louisville.

Devon Dotson scored 15 points, Udoka Azubuike had 12 points and 11 rebounds and Ochai Agbaji had 11 points for the Jayhawks, who fell to 9-2 and had their nine-game winning streak snapped.

Dotson missed a runner in the lane at the buzzer.

Kansas went ahead 53-51 with 2:28 left as Dotson tossed a perfect pass to a cutting Agbaji. After an empty possession, Christian Braun scored in the paint for a 55-51 advantage with 1:49 left.

Dotson missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with 17.5 seconds left and Villanova then turned the ball over.

Villanova missed nine of its first 13 shots but trailed only 14-9 with 9:25 left in the first half.

Justin Moore then drilled a 3-pointer from the wing to cap an 8-0 run and the Wildcats took a 15-14 lead with 7:51 remaining.

Kansas' Marcus Garrett drove to the basket with 5:14 left and appeared to injure his right ankle. Garrett, who stayed down for several minutes before being helped off the court and to the locker room, was ruled out for the game at halftime.

The game was tied at 23 in a hard-fought, defensive battle in the first half. The Jayhawks' 23 points were their fewest in any half all season.
