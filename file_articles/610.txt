Incredible pictures show a wolf gnashing its huge teeth at hounds during a hunting contest in Kazakhstan.

The chaotic scene sees the predator turned prey as it is chased by at least two dogs near Almaty, in the south east of the country.

One shot shows the wolf clamp its jaw around one of the hounds' backs as the dog tries to bite down on its targets neck.

Another sees a red and white dog barge into the wolf and appear to knock it over as the pair flounder in the snow.

Wolf populations are closely protected in Europe, but no legislation is in place in Kazakhstan - where wolf cubs are sometimes bought and used to protect land and property.

The country is believed to have the world's largest population of wild wolves of up to 100,000.
