Elite high school center Hunter Dickinson announced his commitment to Michigan on Friday.

At the end of a highlight-reel video posted to Twitter, Dickinson peels off, one by one, the school and club jerseys he's worn until getting down to the dark blue Wolverines jersey.

He is listed on the 247Sports composite as the nation's No. 6-ranked center and the No. 34 overall prospect in the 2020 class.

The 7-foot-2, 255-pound Dickinson attends DeMatha Catholic in Hyattsville, Md. In October, he announced he had whittled his college choices to four: Michigan, Duke, Florida State and Notre Dame.

He becomes the third member of coach Juwan Howard's 2020 class, joining five-star power forward Isaiah Todd of Raleigh, N.C., and four-star guard Zeb Jackson of Maumee, Ohio.
