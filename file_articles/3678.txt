Malmo is located close to Halmstad, where Ljungberg started his playing career, and the 42-year-old has a close relationship with the club's sports manager Daniel Andersson.

With Arteta not officially taking charge until Sunday, Ljungberg is expected to be in charge for Arsenal's Premier League game away to Everton on Saturday.

Arsenal have won just one out of five games since Ljungberg was named as interim head coach

Mikel Arteta was named Arsenal head coach on Friday and Ljungberg could now depart

Arsenal have won just one of Ljungberg's five games as interim boss. Prior to Emery's departure, he had been working as an assistant coach since the summer and he gained experience coaching the Gunners' U23 side last season.

Ljungberg also had a spell as Wolfsburg's assistant boss in 2017.

Arteta has signed a three-and-a-half year contract with Arsenal and it has been reported that Steve Round, who previously worked for Manchester United and Everton, will be part of his coaching staff.
