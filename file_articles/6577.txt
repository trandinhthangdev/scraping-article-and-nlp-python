'Thank you to whoever originally shared this gift box idea,' the mother captioned her post.

'I used some Kmart Christmas Trivia Cards in each box, along with sweet treats.'

She fashioned the presents by stacking different sized gift boxes from The Reject Shop inside each other, cutting the sides so they open out when the lid is removed.

Using double sided tape, she stuck a selection of sweets inside each layer, placing a gift voucher in the middle.
