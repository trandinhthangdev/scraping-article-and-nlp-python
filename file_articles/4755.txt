Shoppers are obsessing over a spread made from world famous Biscoff biscuits, as jars hit Australian shores for the first time.

The $5.50 Lotus Biscoff spread is created from crushed 'speculoos', a spiced cinnamon Belgian biscuit made from butter, flour, sugar and cookie crumbs.

The products - which are available in 'smooth' or 'crunchy' textures - are spreadable versions of the caramelised biscuits usually found as a complimentary snack with a cup of coffee in hotels across Europe.

The nut-free, vegan-friendly spread is now available at Coles, Woolworths and independent supermarkets nationwide.

Available exclusively in the UK, the present-shaped doughnut has a creamy Lotus Biscoff filling, hand dipped in Biscoff spread with crumbs of cinnamon biscuit and edible gold glitter sprinkled on top.

Chocolate lovers can enjoy a white chocolate version, filled with a blend of Biscoff spread and creamy chocolate and finished with the same Biscoff crumb and glitter topping.
