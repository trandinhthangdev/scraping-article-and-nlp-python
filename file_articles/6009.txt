Serena Williams brought in the big guns to her pre-season training camp in Florida this week when she was joined by boxing legend Mike Tyson.

Williams has been working hard in the tennis off-season with her coach Patrick Mouratoglou, and Tyson lent a hand with a very special boxing workout.

Posting a video of him holding the bag while Williams showed off her punching power, Tyson wrote: 'I don't want to get in the ring with this GOAT. Much love and respect.'

A second post read: 'Hitting the bag with Serena Williams at Boca Resort. She has some power.'

Williams has been training hard at the Boca Raton Resort and Club in Florida as she prepares for the start of the season and some warm-up tournaments ahead of January's Australian Open.

In the video posted by Tyson and Mouratoglou, the boxing legend can be seen giving Williams some hints and teaching her how to jab, before stepping back behind the bag.
