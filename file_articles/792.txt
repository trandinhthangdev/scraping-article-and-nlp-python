Retiring BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie will exit the mining giant three months earlier than planned as his handover to Mike Henry progresses ahead of schedule.

Mr Mackenzie was initially set to retire on June 30 after handing over the reins to Mr Henry in January, but will now leave BHP on March 31.

Mr Henry was announced as Mr Mackenzie's successor in November in what will be the company's first shuffle at the top since 2013.

Mr Henry will officially become CEO of the world's biggest miner on January 1, having spent 16 years with BHP, the last three as president of BHP's Australian minerals division.

Even though Mr Mackenzie will have served as a BHP employee for nine months of the FY20 financial year, he will only be eligible for entitlements under the cash and deferred plan for the six months he spent as chief executive.

Shares in BHP were down 1.38 per cent at $39.17 at 1115 AEDT against a 0.39 per cent drop for the benchmark ASX/200.
