D'Mitrick Trice scored a career-high 31 points and Nate Reuvers had 22 points to help Wisconsin overpower Milwaukee in an 83-64 victory Saturday in Madison, Wis.

The win gave the Badgers (6-5) a sweep against intrastate opponents this season, with victories over Milwaukee, Green Bay and Marquette. Trice made 11 of 14 shots from the field, including 5 of 6 from 3-point distance.

Darius Roy delivered 25 points and Te'Jon Lucas, an Illinois transfer in his first season at Milwaukee after sitting out due to NCAA transfer rules, had 10 points for the Panthers (5-7), who have lost five straight games.

The Badgers shot 50 percent from the field, including a 45.5 percent clip from 3-point range.

The game marked the Badgers debut of junior Micah Potter, an Ohio State transfer who was denied five appeals on transfer waivers by the NCAA's Committee of Legislative Relief after departing the Buckeyes program before the start of the 2018-19 basketball season.

Potter, a 6-foot-10 forward, shot 3 of 6 from the field, scored 12 points and played 13 minutes against Milwaukee. The last time Potter had played was during Ohio State's NCAA Tournament loss to Gonzaga on Nov. 18, 2018.

Wisconsin held a 43-41 halftime lead, but Milwaukee stayed within striking distance in the first half with a 3-point shooting barrage. The Panthers shot 7 of 11 from beyond the arc, including a pair of banked 3-pointers. Roy and Lucas combined for four of those long-range baskets.

The Badgers held the Panthers to 1 of 6 shooting from behind the arc in the second half. They also held Lucas scoreless in the second.

The Panthers scored one point in its first five possessions of the second half, and the Badgers extended their lead to 49-42 on a pair of Reuvers' free throws with 16:12 to go. Wisconsin went up 60-50 on Trice's 3-pointer with 11:22 remaining, and the Badgers led by double digits the rest of the way.
