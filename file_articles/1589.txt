Cricketer David Warner and wife Candice are gearing up for a special Christmas with their young family in Melbourne.

On Sunday, the couple were spotted jetting in from Sydney with their three daughters: Ivy Mae, 5, Indi Rae, 3, and six-month-old Isla Rose.

WAG Candice, 34, looked overjoyed with her newborn child, as the proud parents prepare for the first festive season together as a family of five.

Candice claimed 'our little family is now complete' when she gave birth to Isla in London six months ago in June.

The mum-of-three was glowing as she walked through the terminal in a black T-shirt and a leopard-print skirt with a peplum hem.

Resting her darling daughter on her hip, Candice couldn't help but dote on the little one with kisses and cuddles.

Meanwhile, her other daughters stayed close to their cricketer dad, as he pushed them on a luggage trolley.

The pair, who have been married since 2015, are based in Sydney, but have flown into Melbourne ahead of the Boxing Day Test match.

David wore his cricket-branded polo for the flight, and kept his eldest girls in check as they made their way through the busy airport.

At one point, he was seen with Ivy and Indi with their large suitcases as Candice followed behind with Isla in her pram.

In Sydney last week, the proud parents took their children to The Australian Ballet's Nutcracker performance at the Sydney Opera House.

Taking to Instagram, Candice wrote: 'What a fun little afternoon with the girls. High tea followed by an amazing performance of the Nutcracker. The girls even got to meet the Sugarplum Fairy.'

While in town, David and Candice also hosted a wild Christmas party on a super-yacht in Sydney Harbour with 50 guests.
