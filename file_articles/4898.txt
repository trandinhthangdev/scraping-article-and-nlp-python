BERLIN, Dec 20 (Reuters) - German exports are likely to remain subdued in the coming months as slowing world trade and global risks continue to hurt manufacturers, the Finance Ministry said in its monthly report on Friday.

The German economy has been going through a soft patch. Its export-oriented manufacturers are struggling with trade disputes, its car industry is adapting to a costly shift to electric vehicles, and Britain's planned departure from the European Union is creating uncertainty for businesses.

The Finance Ministry added that Germany's robust labour market should continue to support the domestic economy. (Reporting by Joseph Nasr Editing by Michelle Martin)
