Emergency warnings for fires in Victoria's East Gippsland region have all been downgraded, with firefighters planning to take advantage of mild conditions to strengthen containment lines.

The bushfires, which have been burning since November 21, flared up on Saturday after a cool change passed through the region, bringing with it dry lightning strikes.

Emergency warnings were issued for the towns of Brookville, Ensay, Stirling, Tambo Crossing and Wattle Circle but have since been downgraded to watch-and-act.

"Weather conditions have now changed with the wind and temperature dropping reducing fire behaviour," Emergency Management Victoria said of the out-of-control fire near Brookville.

"This means that embers are no longer being driven by strong winds ahead of the main fire and the forward movement of the fire front has slowed."

Residents of the farming communities were told to leave while they could.

"Don't wait, leaving now is the safest option - conditions may change and get worse very quickly. Emergency Services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay," the new warning read.

A relief centre has been set up at the Omeo Memorial Hall, 60 kilometres north, while generators were being set up on Sunday to restore power and services to the area.

Authorities said the fires were in steep and inaccessible terrain, making it hard for firefighters on the ground and in the air to reach.

In the state's west, residents of Lexton, near Ballarat, were told to evacuate overnight after the cool change threatened to push a nearby bushfire towards the town.

The warning was lifted on Saturday morning and there is no current threat to communities.

"Fire crews, aided by heavy machinery have managed to significantly slow the spread of the fire," the advice message says.
