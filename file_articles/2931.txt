Central Connecticut State has opened the season with 12 consecutive losses.

Penn State knocked down its first 11 shots and quickly jumped out to a 27-10 lead. The 11th field goal, an alley-oop dunk by Watkins, gave him 1,001 career points. Watkins became the 37th player in program history to reach at least 1,000 points.

Outlaw, a freshman, scored 12 of the Blue Devils' first 19 points but they trailed 38-19.

The Nittany Lions made 17 of their first 25 shots and held a 43-22 advantage in the first half.

Jones converted a three-point play as Penn State kept attacking and moved ahead 58-34 less than four minutes into the second half. The Nittany Lions scored the next two baskets and another alley-oop dunk by Watkins, and a spectacular dunk by Stevens pushed the lead to 64-34.

The Blue Devils went through a seven-minute scoring drought and 12 straight misses before Myles Baker finally connected on a 3-pointer.

Myles Dread's deep 3-pointer, his third of the game, with 10:51 remaining extended Penn State's lead to 70-39. The Nittany Lions had little trouble closing out the victory from there.
