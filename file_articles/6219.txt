Nemanja Matic insists he will 'always try to do his best' after he got a rare outing for Manchester United in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.

The Serbian midfielder made just his seventh appearance of the season in the 3-0 win over Colchester United, starting in central midfield and playing the full 90 minutes.

Matic, who is a two-time Premier League winner with Chelsea, is out-of-favour with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but amid rumours of a move to Inter Milan, the 31-year-old said he would continue to be professional and lauded the young players in the changing rooms as the 'future of Manchester United'.

'Of course, when I'm on the field I always try to do my best, I always try to help the team,' Matic told the official club website.

'When I'm on the pitch, I'm happy and I will continue to do my job.

'We have to be more consistent in our games, but this is normal for a young team without experience.

'This is normal and I'm sure those young guys in our changing room - they are the future of Manchester United.'
