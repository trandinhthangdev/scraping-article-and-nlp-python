They say one of the best things to do to get over a breakup is to have a makeover.

And The Block's Shaynna Blaze was looking as sensational as ever as she attended the opening night of Chicago The Musical in Melbourne, on Thursday.

The 56-year-old showed off her incredibly toned figure as she walked the red carpet with a flurry of other stars.

The Channel Nine star, who split with her personal trainer husband Steve Vaughan last year after nearly two decades together, stood out in a monochrome strapless dress.

The black and white checked frock highlighted her decolletage and very toned upper body.

Shaynna teamed the ensemble with a pair of velvet heels and statement tassel earrings.

Her joyful appearance comes a year after she confirmed the end of her relationship with Steve, revealing the news on her Instagram page.

'Sometimes in life, our paths change directions and now this is one of those times for me, with Steve and I separating,' her statement read at the time.

'I will not be making any further statements about this and whilst I appreciate your support I ask that you respect our right to privacy. Thank you, Shaynna.'

Shaynna and Steve tied the knot 18 years ago. They had previously been dating for 11 months, after meeting at a local bar in Melbourne.

Shaynna is the mother of two children: a son, Jesse Thomas, and a daughter, Carly Anne, who she shares with her first husband prior to Steve.
