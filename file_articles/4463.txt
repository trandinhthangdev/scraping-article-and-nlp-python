Quincy McKnight scored a game-high 17 points, including two key free throws with 1.1 seconds left, as host Seton Hall upsets No. 7 Maryland 52-48 on Thursday night in Newark, N.J.

McKnight also added eight rebounds and six assists as the Pirates held off a late Maryland rally to win despite missing their top two scorers, who are out with injuries. Anthony Nelson pitched in with 10 points while Jared Rhoden added eight points and 12 rebounds.

Maryland (10-2) has lost two in a row after winning its first 10 and being ranked as high as No. 3 in the country. But Penn State defeated the Terrapins 76-69 on Dec. 10, and Maryland had not played since then and could not shake off the rust.

The Terrapins needed more than 17 minutes to make it into double figures. They missed 19 of 25 shots in the first half. Their 48 points overall were 11 worse than their next-lowest total of the season. They shot just 26.9 percent from the field for the game.

No. 4 Duke 86, Wofford 57

Sophomore Joey Baker scored a career-best 22 points, and Vernon Carey Jr. added 20 points and 10 rebounds as the fourth-ranked Blue Devils returned to action from a layoff and drubbed the visiting Terriers in Durham, N.C.

There was no encore for Wofford, which toppled North Carolina four days earlier in nearby Chapel Hill. Duke (10-1), which hadn't played since Dec. 6, opened a 26-15 lead on the way to its fourth straight victory.

Duke played without sophomore point guard Tre Jones, who sat out with a mild sprain in his left foot. Junior guard Jordan Goldwire made his second career start in Jones' spot and finished with eight points and five assists.

No. 12 Auburn 79, North Carolina State 73

Guard Samir Doughty scored 24 points and came up with four steals as the Tigers outlasted the visiting Wolfpack to remain unbeaten.

Guard J'Von McCormick added 14 points and center Austin Wiley had three blocks and three steals to go with his 10 points and eight rebounds for the Tigers (10-0), who are off to their best start since the 1998-99 team won its first 17 games.

Guards C.J. Bryce and Markell Johnson each posted double-doubles for North Carolina State (8-3). Bryce scored 21 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, while Johnson finished with 17 points and 10 assists. Bryce fouled out with 1:39 remaining. Johnson played only 30 minutes because of fouls.
