The Detroit Lions activated running back Kerryon Johnson off injured reserve on Saturday with two games left in the regular season.

Johnson suffered a torn meniscus in his right knee during a loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Oct. 20. He has missed the past eight games but is expected to see action Sunday when the Lions (3-10-1) visit the Denver Broncos (5-9).

Johnson had recently lobbied to return as he didn't want to miss the end of a season for the second time in his two NFL seasons.

"For me, as stupid as some people may see it, you know, for me, I like to play, man," Johnson told reporters last week. "I did all this work in the offseason, did all this work in the summer and then I didn't do it to play five games. Obviously my goal every year is to play a full season. Two seasons down, I'm 0-for-2."

Johnson, 22, has rushed for 308 yards and two touchdowns on 92 carries and caught nine passes for 126 yards and one score in six games this season.

A second-round pick in 2018, Johnson rushed for 641 yards and three touchdowns and caught 32 passes for 213 yards and one score in 10 games as a rookie.

Detroit also placed linebacker Christian Jones (shoulder) on injured reserve and promoted defensive end Jonathan Wynn from the practice squad.
