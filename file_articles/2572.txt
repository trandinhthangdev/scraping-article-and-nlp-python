Footballing legend Diego Maradona, 59, has claimed he was once abducted by a UFO and went missing for three days

Interviewers had asked Maradona if he believed in UFOs, with the ex-Napoli star saying: 'Why make things up? Once, after a few too many drinks, I was missing from home for three days.

'I got home and said that UFOs had taken me. I said "They took me, I can’t tell you about it".'

In a rather revealing interview, he was also asked when he lost his virginity.

'At 13 years old, in a basement with an older lady. I was on top and she was reading a newspaper,' said the star, according to the Sun.
