People just can't believe that this lemon cheesecake contains no dairy at all

This lemon cheesecake is loved by everyone who has tasted it – including non-vegans. People just can't believe that it contains no dairy at all, and many who've tried it have since made it often for themselves.

Serves 6-8

For the base

200g (7oz) vegan digestive biscuits, crushed

100g (3½oz) vegan butter or spread, melted

For the filling

2 x 400g tins of full-fat coconut milk, refrigerated

300g (10½oz) ground almonds

60g (2oz) caster sugar

60ml (2¼fl oz) melted coconut oil

1tsp vanilla extract

Zest and juice of 1 lemon, plus extra pared curls of lemon zest, to serve

Method

Mix the crushed digestive biscuits with the melted vegan butter or spread thoroughly.

Pack the mixture into a 20cm round, loose-bottomed cake tin and press down well. Set aside in a cool place, ideally the refrigerator, while you make the cheesecake filling.

Drain the liquid from the tins of coconut milk and discard. Put the solidified coconut cream into a food processor, along with the ground almonds, caster sugar, coconut oil, vanilla extract and the lemon zest and juice. Blitz gently to combine all the ingredients together.

Spoon the filling mixture onto the biscuit base and smooth the top over. Chill for about 2 hours, until fully set. Decorate the top of the cheesecake with some pared curls of lemon zest before serving.
