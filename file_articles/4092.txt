Harrowing photos have shown the devastating extent of one of Australia's worst bushfire seasons on record.

More than 2.7million hectares of land have already been burned through in New South Wales since September - three times the amount scorched in this year's Amazon fires.

The devastation in the state's Southern Highlands on Thursday puts the total number of homes lost at about 750 and six people have been killed by bushfires across Australia.

Brave fire crews across Australia are now bracing for further catastrophic fire danger this weekend, with high winds and temperatures reaching 47C in parts of Sydney creating a perfect storm of weather conditions.

Here, Daily Mail Australia looks back on the most shocking, heartbreaking and jarring images which have gripped the nation in recent months - and the brave fireys who have kept our country safe.
