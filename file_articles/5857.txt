Cruel teenagers who microwaved a cat and posted the sickening footage online sparked death threats across France after an animal rescue charity revealed the abuse.

In harrowing footage the giggling teenagers from Dunkirk can be seen closing the door on the cat as it desperately tries to struggle out of the oven.

The depraved pair then switch on the microwave and watch the helpless animal scramble around and whimper inside.

Screenshots of the video, which was uploaded to social media , were yesterday shared on Facebook by the Dunkirk Animal Protection Society (SPA), which had saved the cat.

Abominable footage shows the cat being rammed into the microwave by the pair and then turned on, with the kitten helplessly whimpering and scrambling around inside the oven

However, on Thursday the SPA removed the post and called for calm after saying the youngsters had received death threats, were named and had their addresses revealed.

'Know that much of this information is totally false!' The SPA wrote. 'The address provided regarding one of the teenagers is absolutely not his own but that of a poor lady living alone and having nothing to do with this story!

'In addition, the families of teenagers receive threats too; these teenagers no longer live at home.

'We are not judges, no lawyers, no police ... Justice must and will do its job!'

Dunkirk Animal Protection Society (SPA) rescued the kitten and revealed they had found a new home for it on Wednesday

The SPA had saved the cat after receiving complaints by those who had witnessed the Snapchat video.

The organisation said it had found a new home for the pet on Wednesday and had filed a complaint about the teens for animal cruelty.

Animal cruelty in France carries up to two years in prison and up to a £25,500 fine, La Peche reported.
