The Chicago White Sox and left-hander Dallas Keuchel agreed to a three-year, $55.5 million deal, multiple outlets reported on Saturday.

The deal reportedly also includes a fourth-year vesting option worth $18.5 million.

Keuchel, the 2015 American League Cy Young Award winner, signed relatively quickly this offseason after enduring a long odyssey last offseason when he was also a free agent. He didn't sign with the Atlanta Braves until June 7 and made his big league season debut on June 21.

Keuchel, who turns 32 on Jan. 1, went 8-8 with a 3.75 ERA in 19 starts for Atlanta.

Overall, Keuchel is 84-71 with a 3.67 ERA in 211 career appearances (202 starts) with the Houston Astros (2012-18) and Braves.

The two-time All-Star went 20-8 with a 2.48 ERA in his banner 2015 season with Houston.
