The British Horseracing Authority on Thursday claimed the bloodstock industry has been harmed by 'a culture of unethical, and in some cases unlawful, practices by a small number of unscrupulous individuals'.

In its review into the buying and selling of bloodstock and racehorses, published on Thursday, the BHA set out a series of recommendations which they hope will safeguard and reform a part of the industry which has attracted more than its share of unwanted headlines in recent time.

The BHA insist a 'vast majority' within the sector conduct themselves with integrity, but the creation of the Bloodstock Industry Forum (BIF), one of eight recommendations in the report, has been introduced to produce a robust Code of Practice which all areas of the sector must adhere to.

The meeting at Exeter on Thursday was abandoned after three races because of standing water on the track, while Uttoxeter will inspect at 8am to see if Friday's meeting can go ahead.
