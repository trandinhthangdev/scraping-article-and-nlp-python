Dec 21 (Reuters) - A last-gasp goal from Jay Rodriguez helped Burnley snatch a 1-0 away victory over Bournemouth in a scrappy Premier League affair at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday.

Both teams struggled to create chances in a physical mid-table clash played under heavy showers, with Bournemouth dominating possession.

Yet Burnley scored with their only attempt on target as forward Rodriguez nodded home a cross from Ashley Westwood in the 89th minute.

The match was disrupted by 34 fouls, with referee Martin Atkinson producing six yellow cards -- four being shown to the visitors.

The result helped Sean Dyche's Burnley move into the top half of the league table, while Bournemouth remained 14th after 18 matches.
