England captain Eoin Morgan landed a £565,000 bounty on Thursday after being re-signed by Kolkata Knight Riders at the Indian Premier League auction.

Morgan, 33, proved an attractive lot at the end of World Cup-winning year, eventually being snapped up by his close friend Brendon McCullum, the Knight Riders' new head coach, while another England international Sam Curran also fetched half-a-million, joining Chennai Super Kings for £593,000 a year and a day after Kings XI Punjab secured him for £800,000.

Kolkata, hosts of the auction, also paid a record sum of rupees for a foreigner in recruiting Australian fast bowler Pat Cummins, although the price in sterling of £1.67million was less than the £1.7million Ben Stokes went to Pune for in early 2017 due to fluctuating exchange rates.

Cummins was one of three overnight millionaires in the latest recruitment for the world's leading Twenty20 competition, alongside compatriot Glenn Maxwell and South African all-rounder Chris Morris, who hooked up with Punjab and Royal Challengers Bangalore respectively.

The elder Curran sibling, Tom, added to the English contingent at Rajasthan with a £108,000 contract, after initially going unsold.

Stokes, Jos Buttler and Jofra Archer had been retained by the Royals, whose capture of teenage batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal for £260,000 was the heart-warming story of the event.

Three of his adolescent years were spent sleeping rough in a tent at a cricket ground in his quest to become a professional.

Jason Roy, Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan also return to the competition in 2020 but there was no room for two of England's World Cup final XI in Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood.
