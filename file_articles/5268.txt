Colorado wide receiver K.D. Nixon changed his mind about entering the NFL draft and will return to the Buffaloes for his senior season in 2020.

"After thoughtful evaluation and conversations with (coach Mel) Tucker and others about my future in football -- and beyond, I have decided to continue my college football career at Colorado, earn my degree and declare for the NFL Draft in 2021," Nixon said in a statement released Thursday. "I look forward to contributing to the Buffaloes next season and making a difference for our team."

Nixon never signed with an agent.

He caught 35 passes for 465 yards and three touchdowns in 12 games in 2019, raising his three-year career totals to 89 receptions for 1,118 yards and seven scores.

Nixon has rushed 17 times for 31 yards and a touchdown and returned 36 kickoffs for 758 yards. He also has one passing touchdown.
