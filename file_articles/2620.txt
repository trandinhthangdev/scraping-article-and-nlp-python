Environmental activists are calling for the traditional Christmas cracker to be banned as they contribute to plastic waste.

Environmentalist and founder of eco-friendly online store Biome, Tracey Bailey, says the Christmas tradition is responsible for a large contribution of plastic waste to landfill every year.

Ms Bailey told the Courier Mail that the disposable plastic toys inside the crackers should be considered just as harmful as other single use plastic items including straws, cutlery, beverage stirrers and cotton buds.

She believed that the plastic trinkets should be included in worldwide government bans on single use plastics and explained: 'They are just as likely to end up washing down drains and in to our oceans.'

Ms Bailey said that families could help reduce the large amount of rubbish over Christmastime by abstaining from purchasing crackers with the plastic toys.

She told how the yule tradition led to excess waste and said: 'Once the festivities are over, the toys are usually forgotten and discarded with the rubbish from Christmas lunch or dinner.'

A spokesperson from the environmental organisation Planet Ark said that avoiding bonbons would be a good way to reduce the impact of Christmas waste.

He said: 'It is possible to make your own low waste bonbons by using recycled paper and treats you've made yourself.'

Ms Bailey explained that making your own plastic free Christmas crackers would be a good eco friendly alternative.

She said that you can use cardboard toilet roll inserts, recycled paper and twine to create the outside shell and replace the plastic toy with a random act of kindness card for the recipient to complete.
