The Atletico Madrid striker has recently had surgery on a slipped disc and is in light training

Costa has already missed the last month of action and is currently in light training with the squad.

Atletico have been linked with a move in January for a striker with Costa out and summer signing Joao Felix struggling for goals.

Alvaro Morata has had to take on the burden of the goals but Simeone has remained tight-lipped on whether he will improve his squad in the next transfer window.

Diego Simeone's side are struggling with injuries at the moment with Stefan Savic and Sime Vrsaljko doubts for their away trip to Real Betis on Sunday.

Vitolo and Koke are already confirmed out of the match but should be back after the winter break.
