A four-year-old's pet rabbit was skinned and mutilated in its garden enclosure in the night.

Monique Johnson, from Baldivis in Perth, found her daughter's rabbit Bob clinging to life with one ear cut off and its shoulder skinned.

She took the beloved pet to the vet but it was too mutilated to be saved and had to be put down.

Ms Johnson believes someone broke into her garden to commit the horrific act of abuse. Police are investigating.

Ms Johnson told 7News: 'It's absolutely psychotic. I just think it's someone who has no morals whatsoever.'

As a result of the horrific attack, Ms Johnson said she is afraid to leave any of her other pets outside.

She is yet to tell her daughter what has happened.

'She loved him, she'd always go out there and you know she's watched them since they were literally born,' she said.

Animal cruelty is illegal under the Animal Welfare Act 2002 and carries a maximum penalty of a $50,000 fine or up to five years in prison.
