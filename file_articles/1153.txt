In response to reports that a knife had been involved, Detective Chief Inspector Alex Geldart, of the Sussex and Surrey major crime team, said: “I wish to make it absolutely clear that this is not a knife crime.”

She added: “At this time we believe this to be an isolated incident, with no ongoing risk to members of the public.

“This is a fast-moving investigation which will see significant police resources deployed to the scene for the forseeable future.

“We are grateful for the support and patience of the local community while we conduct our enquiries.”

Three forensic tents were pitched in the street, while residents said 10 police cars had initially been dispatched to the scene to deal with the incident.

Investigators in white forensic suits could be seen combing the area for evidence.

A police cordon remains in place around the houses close to where the bodies were found.
