Manchester United's preparations for their clash at Watford have been hampered after their team bus turned up just an hour before kick-off.

The Red Devils take on Watford at Vicarage Road in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon, and a victory would take them just one point below the top four.

But their build-up was far from ideal after their bus was spotted arriving just 60 minutes before the 2pm kick-off.

No reason for United's delay has yet been given but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side were against the clock in the warm-up.

Their late arrival also meant the Red Devils' warm-up was also pushed back.

United have been known to turn up late to matches before, including against Valencia in the Champions League last season under Jose Mourinho and twice against West Ham and Tottenham when Louis van Gaal was in charge.

United head into Sunday's Premier League encounter in strong form, winning four out of their last five matches in all competitions.

However, they will be desperate to bounce back from their disappointing 1-1 draw against Everton at Old Trafford last time out in the Premier League.

Paul Pogba has given United a big boost by returning to the matchday squad after recovering from a long-term ankle injury and illness.
