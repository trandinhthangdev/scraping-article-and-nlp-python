Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero has joked that Cristiano Ronaldo should have been shown a card for his astonishing header for Juventus.

Ronaldo stunned the football world yet again during the week after incredibly jumping eight feet before hanging in the air for 1.5 seconds to score the gravity-defying header in the 2-1 victory.

And after letting the reaction die down, the Sampdoria president opted for a typically unorthodox reaction to Ronaldo's moment of magic.

Ferrero joked: 'I must say that Ronaldo had to be booked after that leap.

'It was as if he was taking off like an airplane! Cristiano won the game, but my boys defended well.'

The Portuguese international scored his 10th goal of the Serie A campaign to give Juventus a three-point lead ahead of Inter Milan at the top of the table.
