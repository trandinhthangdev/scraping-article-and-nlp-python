DUBLIN, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The Irish High Court will rule on Monday Dec. 23 on whether Ryanair can prevent its operations chief Peter Bellew from joining arch-rival easyJet until 2021, a court official said on Friday.

Ryanair has argued that Bellew possesses information of competitive value and that he is bound by a non-compete clause.

Former Malaysia Airlines boss Bellew denies he is subject to the clause and plans to start working with the British airline at the start of 2020 after completing a six-month notice period.

The verdict had been due on Friday, but was delayed, the official said. (Reporting by Conor Humphries; editing by David Evans)
