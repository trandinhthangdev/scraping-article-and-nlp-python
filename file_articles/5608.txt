Former Bayern Munich manager Jupp Heynckes has praised the quality of Robert Lewandowski after the Pole overtook him in the all-time Bundesliga goalscoring charts.

Lewandowski scored his 221st Bundesliga goal in Bayern's 3-1 win against Freiburg on Wednesday and in doing so went ahead of Heynckes' record of 220 goals.

After managing him at Bayern in the 2017-18 season, Heynckes is all too aware of the 31-year-old's ability and was full of praise after he went past him in the standings.

Robert Lewandowski's goal against Freiburg was also his 30th already this season

'What impresses me about Robert Lewandowski is his professionalism, ambition, passion, bite and fitness,' Heynckes told the German press agency on Thursday.

'He is an absolute world class player, especially this season. It was a privilege for me to have worked with him.

'He deserved to outperform me in the eternal list of goalscorers.'
