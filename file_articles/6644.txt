A university graduate and model has shared her daily beauty routine and the luxury products she uses to keep her skin clear for work.

American-born Gilda Joelle Osborn is building a high fashion portfolio of work with the likes of Oribe and Lilly Pulitzer, but has a penchant for testing different makeup products and skincare brands behind-the-scenes.

She spoke to Husskie Australia about the lip tints, bronzers and concealers she keeps in her $590 Louis Vuitton toiletry bag, which is 'big enough to hold everything'.

In the morning Gilda reaches for her $453 Dr Barbara Sturm Hyaluronic Serum, a much-loved brand used by Hollywood's top-tier celebrities, followed by a $49 Indie Lee toner and 'protective day oil'.

She prefers to cleanse at night after her day is finished with the $60.94 One Love Organics Botanical B Cleansing Oil, which works to remove heavy eye makeup after a shoot.

To treat herself Gilda enjoys using $105 Tata Harper masks or $89.72 Evolve's Instant Glow mask, which both work to exfoliate and re-hydrate her face.

Once her skin is prepped the blonde bombshell applies $65.87 Beauty Counter Dew Skin tinted moisturiser for a light tint, or if she needs something heavier, the $78.47 Vapour Beauty Soft Focus foundation.

Gilda is a fan of natural paraben-free makeup and chooses to incorporate it where possible, like concealing her under eyes with $52.50 RMS Beauty's un cover-up.

For adding a touch of colour she uses a bronzing stick to contour and a light blush to give her face a flushed look.

She steers clear of eyeliner but never forgets to curl her lashes, adding a lick of $25 Lily Lolo mascara to embolden her appearance.

'I am definitely more of a lip balm girl [than lipstick]. I literally own two lipsticks, one being just a tint. My favourite tint is $30.63 Henne Organics lip tint in Intrigue,' she told the publication.

Best known for her shapely and bold brows, Gilda would 'never leave the house' without putting the $37.92 EcoBrow eyebrow wax through her strands.

She applies it with an angled brush to get the most natural look possible.
