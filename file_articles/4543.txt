A Melbourne IT worker who stalked a policeman, compared himself to the Bourke Street killer and threatened an explosion in the CBD will serve a three-year community corrections order.

Stephen Macras, 34, pleaded guilty to stalking, making a bomb hoax and assaulting an emergency worker on duty between 2017 and 2019.

He was jailed on Friday in the County Court for 187 days, or time already served, and must also undergo a three-year community corrections order. Judge Paul Lacava accepted he was suffering a major depressive illness at the time.
