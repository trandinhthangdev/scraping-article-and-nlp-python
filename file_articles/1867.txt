Online greeting card company Moonpig has hit sales of £100million following a surge in demand for its personalised post.

The company said an 82 per cent rise in sales through its app showed more people were ordering cards on their phones or computers instead of going out to the shops.

Once a customer has submitted an online order, Moonpig dispatches the card with a personal message to the recipient.

Moonpig, founded by Dragons’ Den star Nick Jenkins and now chaired by City heavyweight Kate Swann, said it reached the landmark figure in the year to June.

Group chief executive Nickyl Raithatha said: ‘Customers have bought into our vision. A personalised card is always more meaningful, whether sent from the sofa, the commute, or the gym.’

The business has introduced giant cards, exclusively branded ranges with Disney and Warner Brothers and a reminder service to prompt customers into action.

Jenkins sold the business in 2011 and Swann, formerly chief executive at WHSmith, was appointed in August.

This year also saw Moonpig separate from its parent company Photobox into an autonomous business alongside its Dutch sister firm Greetz. Swann said 90 per cent of greeting cards are still sold offline so there is ‘still a huge potential for growth’.
