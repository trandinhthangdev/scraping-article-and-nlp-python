A compassionate man has been called an 'angel' for spraying a distressed owl with his hose during a 44C heatwave.

The Adelaide man and his wife found the owl suffering outside of their home during one of Australia's worst heatwaves.

The couple found the owl underneath a tree in broad daylight and said it was 'panting like a dog,' according to ABC News.

This unusual behavior from the nocturnal creature signaled that something was wrong.

Its strange reaction prompted the couple to use their garden hose to spray the owl and cool it down.

Adelaide was faced with an extreme heatwave throughout the week and suffered temperatures up to 16C higher than the average on Friday.

The video was originally uploaded on Wednesday and showed the brown owl basking in the spray and turning its head from side to side for more cool relief.

Viewers of the footage were quick to share their praise for the kind-hearted man.

One said: 'Good for him, what a great angel.'

Another commented: 'This guy has a good heart to do this for that poor owl!'

Commenters also expressed their concern for Australia's animals during the extreme conditions.

One viewer worried about the owl and said: 'I hope he'll be OK. Such a terrible heatwave!'
