'We had an early Christmas the other day and my brother found out I was vegan,' he told The Project.

'He works at a cheese factory, so he basically thinks i'm trying to ruin his life because I'm no longer eating cheese,' the comedian added.

Even so, the comedian confirmed that although it will be his first Christmas working around his vegan lifestyle, he was still 'very excited for Christmas'.

Despite feeling as though he has 'given up pretty much everything', Dave still has a few culinary vices.

'I still eat a lot of salt. I love salt. i'll never give up salt. Whenever I have chips, I put a massive pile of salt and I roll the chips in the salt like i'm making a lamington,' he revealed.

He told The Project panel that vegans are often perceived as very healthy, but that isn't always the case.

'Vegans often put on weight because all we eat is chips. Chips are my favourite thing. There's no doubt about that. I tried to give up chips but it didn't work,' he said.

He went on to reveal that he does not feed his two dogs a vegan diet.

While veganism is a new choice for Dave, he has been an advocate for meat-free living, explaining that he felt that if 'slaughterhouses had glass walls, everybody would be vegetarian.'
