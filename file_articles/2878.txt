Minnesota Wild forward Jason Zucker underwent successful surgery on a fractured right fibula Friday and is expected to be out of action four to six weeks.

Zucker, 27, was injured in Sunday's 5-3 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks when he was hit in the leg by a Brent Seabrook slapshot. He left the ice but returned to finish out the game.

Zucker has 12 goals and 12 assists in 34 games, with his 24 points tied for second most on the team. The nine-year veteran has 130 goals and 108 assists in 445 career games, all with the Wild.
