This is one of my favourite dessert recipes: light, crisp pastry with a frangipane topping. Everyone who tries it loves it.

Serves 6-8

For the pastry

225g (8oz) plain flour

25g (1oz) ground almonds

150g (5½oz) pure coconut oil or vegan butter or spread

A pinch of salt

For the frangipane filling

180g (6oz) ground almonds

90g (3¼oz) caster sugar

75g (2¾oz) vegan spread

2tbsp cornflour

180ml (6fl oz) almond milk

1tsp vanilla extract

1½tsp almond extract

A pinch of salt

To decorate

200g (7oz) raspberry jam

80g (3oz) icing sugar

50g (1¾oz) dark chocolate, melted

Method

Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan 160°C/gas 4. Mix all the ingredients for the pastry together in a bowl by hand, until the mixture forms a dough. Alternatively, blitz in a food processor for 1 minute, until well combined.

Form the pastry into a ball, flatten it slightly and place it between 2 large sheets of greaseproof paper. Roll the pastry out, thinly, to fit a 25cm round shallow flan tin. Prick the pastry all over with a fork, then place in the freezer for 20 minutes.

Bake the tart case for 18-20 minutes, until just golden at the edges. Set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, put all the frangipane filling ingredients in a food processor and mix to a smooth batter.

Spread a thin layer of jam all over the bottom of the cooled tart case (the quantity can be adjusted to taste: the more jam, the sweeter the tart), then pour the frangipane mixture all over to cover.

Bake for 30 minutes, until the filling is puffed up and golden. Set aside to cool.

To decorate, add 2½-3tsp water to the icing sugar and mix. Drizzle the tart with a thin layer of icing, then pipe the melted dark chocolate all over to finish.
