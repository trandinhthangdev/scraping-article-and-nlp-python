A 90mph police chase down narrow country lanes has been captured on video - ending with a reckless motorist crashing into a tree.

The footage was filmed by a police dashcam during the night time pursuit of the speeding car in Hampshire's New Forest.

The hair-raising black and white video shows the Audi A1 racing away from the chasing unmarked police car along twisting roads until it finally comes to a stop after hitting a tree.

The driver, Jack Mason, then ran off, leaving his injured girlfriend behind in the vehicle.

The 28-year-old was jailed for 12 weeks after being found guilty of dangerous driving, failing to stop for police and driving without insurance following the incident.

Southampton Crown Court heard Mason was behind the wheel of his girlfriend's car when police spotted him speeding.

Ignoring signals to stop, the driver sped off at speeds of up to 90mph in a pursuit that lasted six minutes

PC Richard Miell, from the Joint Roads Policing Unit, said: 'The footage clearly shows just how dangerous and reckless Mason's driving was.

'He showed absolutely no consideration for anyone else on the roads, including his own girlfriend who was in the car with him.

'Driving at such ridiculous speeds, especially on the narrow residential roads of the New Forest, could have easily resulted in someone being seriously injured or killed and he is incredibly lucky that he doesn't have to live with that on his conscience.'
