Pep Guardiola will begin planning for next season in the coming weeks, with transfer targets and finding a replacement for Mikel Arteta high on the agenda.

Guardiola, who has 18 months left on his contract, is expecting to hold talks with the Manchester City hierarchy over January and February.

There are no plans to immediately replace Arteta, who was confirmed as Arsenal's new boss on Friday, and first-team coach Rodolfo Borrell will take on more responsibility in the meantime.

Guardiola is not looking to rebuild the squad, but as many as four fresh faces have been mooted. David Silva is leaving, while the future of fellow midfielder-cum-defender Fernandinho is unclear, with his contract due to expire at the end of the season.

City are focusing their attention on central defenders, but on Friday Guardiola ruled out reviving his interest in Jonny Evans, who is set to face City with Leicester at the Etihad on Saturday.

As for his own future, Guardiola reiterated he could stay beyond next season.

'We have an incredible relationship with the board,' he said. 'I would like to stay as long as possible. That is my desire, but I will only be sure if it's the best for the club. It's important to be sure that the decision is perfect for both sides.'
