A six-year-old boy has died after a car rollover at Lake Argyle in Western Australia's far north.

The boy was one of four people travelling in a Holden Commodore which left the road, hit an embankment and rolled several times on Saturday afternoon.

He died on the way to hospital.

A 23-year-old woman who was driving the car and a 29-year-old man were taken to the Kununurra Hospital with minor injuries.

A 14-year-old boy received serious injuries and was also conveyed to Kununurra Hospital but is likely to be transferred for further treatment.

The incident is being investigated with major crash police wanting to speak with the people who stopped to help the injured.
