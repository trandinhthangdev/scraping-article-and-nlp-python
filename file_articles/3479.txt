Series Record: First meeting

WHAT'S AT STAKE

San Diego State is making a school-record 10th straight bowl appearance but hasn't won a bowl game since its 31-10 victory over Houston in the 2016 Las Vegas Bowl. The Aztecs lost to Ohio 27-0 in the Frisco Bowl last year. This season, San Diego State started with a 7-1 record then dropped two of its last three conference games to fall out of contention for a Mountain West title game berth. Meanwhile, the Chippewas under first year under coach Jim McElwain completed one of the nation's biggest turnarounds following a 1-11 season - the school's worst. Under McElwain, Central Michigan won the Mid-American Conference West and reached the title game for the first time since 2009.
