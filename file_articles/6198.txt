JOHANNESBURG, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Former managers from South Africa's troubled state-run power firm Eskom have been arrested, a spokesman for the elite police unit the Hawks said on Thursday. An Eskom spokeswoman said she was not aware of the arrests.

A breaking news banner run on local TV news channel eNCA said the people had been arrested for alleged fraud and corruption amounting to some 745 million rand ($50.65 million). (Reporting by Emma Rumney and Mfuneko Toyana; Editing by Alison Williams)
