LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Facebook's Libra project has no solid strategy yet for how or where it will be introduced next year, a board member of the body overseeing the hotly-anticipated cryptocurrency told Reuters on Thursday.

Libra is on track to launch in 2020, but the scope of the roll-out depends on talks with regulators, said Patrick Ellis, one of five board members for the Geneva-based Libra Association that will issue and govern the digital currency.

"At this stage, there is no strategy set in stone for the markets or the product, or how it will actually get rolled out," Ellis said in a phone interview from Singapore.

The prospect of Libra being used by Facebook's near-2.4 billion users has drawn fierce scrutiny from authorities around the world, nervous it could alter the global financial landscape. (Reporting by Tom Wilson; editing by Marc Jones)
