An Adelaide woman is in a critical condition in hospital after being hit by a car and then clinging to the bonnet as it sped away.

The incident followed an alleged altercation between the woman and two men who arrived at a home at suburban Ottoway on Friday.

Police allege the woman was hit as the men drove away and she clung to the front of the bonnet for some time before falling onto the road.

A 27-year-old man has since been arrested and charged with attempted murder.
