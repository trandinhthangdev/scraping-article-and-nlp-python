BEIJING, Dec 20 (Reuters) - London copper prices held steady above $6,200 a tonne in early Asian trade on Friday, heading for their fifth straight weekly gain on easing U.S.-China trade tensions and an improving demand outlook in top consumer China. The metal widely used in construction and power is on course to add 1.4% this week and is up 4.2% so far this year.
