A suspected terrorist has been 'neutralised' by Russian police after a shooting 'left three people dead' near Moscow's FSB headquarters.

The gunman was killed after a dramatic shoot out in the heart of the Russian capital, which saw people fleeing through the streets in terror.

Shots were fired directly behind the security agency's headquarters in Lubyanka Square just before 6pm local time today.

The horror unfolded shortly after President Vladimir Putin delivered his annual news conference and while he was speaking at a Kremlin event designed to celebrate the work of the security services.

The FSB, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, suspected the attack may have been planned to coincide with Putin's speech, a source close to the agency told Reuters.

Russian investigators are believed to have classed the attack as a terrorist incident.

Amid conflicting reports from Moscow, local news outlets claim three people have been killed and five others injured. The FSB has now confirmed one of the casualties was an FSB officer.

An earlier account of the attack said three attackers were involved in the shooting, with one returning fire at law enforcement officers, but this was not confirmed.

The security agency insisted the attack was only carried out by one person, according to the Interfax news agency.

They also quoted the Russian health ministry as saying five people were injured in the shooting, including two security officers.

Footage posted on social media showed automatic gunfire hitting the walls of the FSB's main building on Lubyanka Square in central Moscow.

Sirens, gunshots and screams were heard by people in the area, which is also a busy shopping district popular with tourists that is a short walk from the Kremlin.

Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had been informed of the shooting that came shortly after the Russian leader's annual news conference.

In a speech marking the date the Soviet secret police was founded, Putin hailed its officers for their efforts in combating terrorism and organized crime.

Freelance journalist Sotiri Dimpinoudis reported that a 'loud explosion' was heard 'in the perimeter of the FSB building' shortly after the shooting occurred.

Russian special forces with automatic weapons were deployed and five ambulances were seen leaving the scene.

At least ten gunshots are said to have been heard with one man shouting 'Stop, I said stop'.

One man wounded was named as Ilya Fisenko, 32. It has been reported that he was a traffic policeman on duty outside the FSB headquarters and died at the scene.

Videos shared on social media show people, thought to be officers, making their way along an empty street and terrified members of the public running away.

According to conflicting reports, an unknown man fired at the FSB checkpoint and ran out into the street before barricading himself in buildings.
