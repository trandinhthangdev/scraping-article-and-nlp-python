Tim Robards and Anna Heinrich have been making up for lost time since the former Bachelor returned home to Sydney from filming Neighbours in Melbourne.

And on Friday, the genetically-blessed pair spent some more quality time together as they went for an early morning swim at Bondi Beach.

The lawyer looked effortlessly chic wearing a muted sand-hued co-ord, which she paired with a casual cane basket and a pair of white heels.

Husband and wife time: Tim Robards and Anna Heinrich spent some quality time together as they went for an early morning swim at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Friday

Meanwhile, her husband Tim turned heads, showing off his famous chiselled frame in just a pair of white swim shorts with navy stripes.

Last month, after weeks of rumours, Anna was forced to deny she'd split with Tim during an awkward confrontation with Kyle Sandilands on Trial By Kyle.

Discussing the episode's first case between a husband who had accused his wife of stealing money from him for Botox, Kyle couldn't resist asking Anna about her relationship with Tim.

'What's happening at your place with you and Tim? Things aren't good?' he responded.

Suns out, guns out! Meanwhile her husband Tim turned heads, showing off his famous chiselled frame wearing just a pair of white shorts with navy stripes.

Seemingly taken aback, a tense Anna told Kyle 'things are great' between herself and her husband of a little over a year.

'I read something in New Idea a while back. I wasn't sure whether it was, uh...' Kyle continued, seemingly determined not to let it go.

'No. He's still my husband,' Anna responded tersely, before burying her head in her case notes.

Anna and Tim fell in love on the first season of The Bachelor Australia and tied the knot in June 2018 in Italy.
