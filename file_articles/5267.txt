The Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday ruled out star wide receiver Chris Godwin for Saturday's game against the Houston Texans, coach Bruce Arians announced.

Godwin sustained a hamstring injury in Sunday's 38-17 victory over the Detroit Lions.

Other Bucs who won't play include tight end Tanner Hudson (concussion) and defensive tackle Beau Allen (ankle).

"It's just next man up. That's what you always do. One man's injury is another man's opportunity, and somebody will shine," Arians said via ESPN.

Already taking advantage of the situation is Breshad Perriman, who caught five passes for 113 yards and three touchdowns in the victory over the Lions.

Arian said he hopes Godwin, who earned his first Pro Bowl selection this week, will be able to return for the regular-season finale against the Atlanta Falcons on Dec. 29. But with the Bucs out of playoff contention, he could also decide to shut down Godwin for the rest of the season.

Godwin, 23, has 86 catches for 1,333 yards and nine touchdowns this season, his third in the NFL. He currently ranks second in the league in receiving yards.

Hamstring issues also led to Bucs wideouts Mike Evans and Scotty Miller going on injured reserve.
