MARTIN, Tenn. (AP) -

Dana Evans scored 22 points and No. 6 Louisville outlasted UT Martin 71-63 in double overtime Thursday night after trailing for nearly all of regulation.

Kylee Shook and Diop each added 15 points for the Cardinals (11-1). Louisville took the lead for good with 3:05 left in the second overtime.

"You´ve got to have the mindset that every game is important and that you´re trying to win every single game, not just win enough to make the NCAA Tournament," Cardinals coach Jeff Waltz said. "I´m trying to get back to a Final Four and win a national championship. I don´t care who we are playing, our goal is to get better."

Damiah Griffin led the Skyhawks (4-6) with 25 points and 10 rebounds.

"The kids´ effort was unbelievable. We´ve just got to figure out how to make easy shots," UT Martin coach Kevin McMillan said. "We´ve got to do the little things to win at this level and we´re just not at this level. We´ve got to grow up and learn how to finish games off and I hope we will."

The Cardinals made 18 of 20 free throws, while the Skyhawks were 15 of 28.

BIG PICTURE:

Louisville: The Cardinals found a way to avoid an upset in their nonconference finale, wrapping up a string of seven straight road or neutral-site games at 6-1.

UT Martin: The Skyhawks kept pace with a much bigger, more physical ranked opponent, giving the young Ohio Valley Conference squad momentum going into a road contest with No. 20 Arkansas.
