Mikel Arteta 'could make Sevilla wonderkid Antonio Zarzana his first signing as Arsenal manager' though Liverpool are also interested in the midfielder.

Arteta, who is currently No 2 to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, is set to be confirmed as Arsenal's new manager on Friday after the two Premier League clubs reached an agreement.

And one of his first acts could be to complete a move for 17-year-old Zarzana in the January transfer window after Arsenal made enquiries.

According to Spanish newspaper Estadio Deportivo, the Gunners are just the latest club to express an interest in the teenager, who turned down a move to Real Madrid last year.

Liverpool and Bayern Munich have also watched him play for Sevilla's B team in the Segunda B, the third tier of Spanish football.

Zarzana rejected a move to Real Madrid last year because his ambition was to play for Sevilla's first team.

'I heard that Real Madrid had put an offer in for me last year,' he told Marca recently. 'But I have always wanted to make my debut with the first team here.'

But with a number of elite European teams now chasing him, those aspirations could soon change.

As if to rub in his rejection of Real, he scored a perfectly-executed 'Panenka' kick against them in the Champions Cup youth tournament back in May.

Zarzana was just 16 when he made his debut for Sevilla's B team in May 2018, coming off the bench late in a 2-1 home win over Numancia.
