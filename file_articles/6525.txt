Three South Australian men have been jailed over what prosecutors claim was the biggest methamphetamine lab discovered in the state.

Troy Alviti, Mark Anthony Middleton and Nicholas James Wardle each pleaded guilty to manufacturing a large commercial quantity of the drug, which was found at a house at Croydon, north of the CBD, in 2018.

During a raid, police discovered enough chemicals to make 127 kilograms of ice, which could have been worth more than $20 million.

The trio were in the process of manufacturing a further 15.6 kilograms when they were caught.

"Drugs such as the one under consideration here, are a scourge on our community," Judge Jack Costello said while sentencing the men in the Supreme Court on Thursday.

"They are out to destroy the lives of not just those who use them, but also the lives of a much wider circle of people who depend on those who use them."

Judge Costello said the men were motivated by money and held senior positions in the illicit operation, but likely were acting with others who were not caught.

"I regard the conduct of each of you, which Ms Amos from the DPP (Director of Public Prosecutions) described as the largest manufacturing offence of its type in the history of the state, as being equally culpable," he said.

The drug operation was so big it took a team of police and forensic personnel six days to dismantle, Judge Costello said.

Alviti, 47, was jailed for 10 years, 10 months and six days, with a non-parole period of six years and 10 months, including a revoked suspended sentence.

Middleton, 58, was jailed for 10 years and six months with a non-parole period of eight years, four months and three weeks.

Wardle, 39, was jailed for seven years and six months with a non-parole period of four years and six months.
