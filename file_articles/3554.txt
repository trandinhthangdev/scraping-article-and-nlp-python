LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a U.S. diplomat, will not return voluntarily to Britain to face charges for causing death by dangerous driving, her lawyer said on Friday.

British prosecutors said earlier they have decided to charge Sacoolas over a car crash in central England in August in which a teenager died.

"Anne will not return voluntarily to the United Kingdom to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident," lawyer Amy Jeffress said in a statement. (Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Stephen Addison)
