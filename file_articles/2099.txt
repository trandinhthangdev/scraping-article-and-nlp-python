50 Cent is gunning for 'father of the year' with less than two weeks left until the new year.

The rapper just treated son Sire to a Christmas present that's bound to leave a few kids jealous.

Sire took to his Instagram (which boasts nearly 70k followers) Saturday, to share photos from a private shopping spree at Toys 'R' Us.

According to TMZ, the rapper, 44, dropped $100k to rent out the store and close it off to the public.

The personalized experience came with an altered logo decal on the floor, featuring Sire's face and reading 'Sire's Toys "R" Us.'

The entire store was opened exclusively for the seven-year-old to pick out any toy he wanted.

He went with some classics, as he checked out some Legos, Nerf guns and some Nintendo games.

Father and son also took a photo with the store's beloved mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe.

The photos were captioned: 'When I asked my Dad for the “WHOLE Toys R Us Store” for Christmas I didn’t think he would actually do it, but he did. Thank you Daddy! Best Christmas Ever!'

The New Jersey store where the shopping spree took place is one of only two remaining locations.

The toy store chain closed down last year before slowly reopening under new ownership.

50 welcomed Sire back in 2012 with ex Daphne Joy, 32, who was also present for the shopping spree.

The rapper also shares son Marquise, 23, with his ex-girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins.
