Canterbury have re-signed captain Josh Jackson on a three-year deal that will keep him at the NRL club until the end of 2023.

Jackson had been off-contract at the end of 2020, but the Bulldogs have ensured speculation over his future won't go into the new year.

"He is an incredibly popular figure here at Belmore and he represents everything that is great about our club in the way that he carries himself on and off the field," Bulldogs chief executive Andrew Hill said.
