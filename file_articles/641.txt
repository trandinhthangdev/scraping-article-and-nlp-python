The federal government is backing two new gas power projects in Queensland and Victoria.

Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor on Monday said the government has reached an initial agreement to underwrite gas generators at Dandenong in Victoria and Gatton in Queensland.

A final agreement on the projects is expected to be reached next year, and construction is expected to begin after the projects get private sector finance.

Mr Taylor said the government would now enter detailed underwriting and contractual negotiations with the project promoters before they make investment decisions.

He said the projects were well advanced, had demonstrated financial viability and would secure the grid and lower power prices.

Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners is proposing a 132MW gas generator in Queensland while APA Group is behind a proposal for a 220MW gas generator in Victoria.

Both projects were on a shortlist of 12 as part of an underwriting program before the May election.

Of the projects shortlisted, five are gas generators, six are pumped-storage hydroelectricity and one is a coal station upgrade.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison also flagged a new coal-fired power station for Queensland and stations in NSW during an interview with 2GB radio on Monday.

"There's a proposal for Collinsville up in North Queensland which we're expecting a report on very, very soon," Mr Morrison said.

Asked whether renewable energy was the way of the future Mr Morrison said Australia needed a mix of energy sources.

"Well, look, you need the whole mix, there's no doubt about that," Mr Morrison said.

"I'm quite agnostic, just as long as it's reliable and it's cheaper."

He said he aimed to balance environmental issues with economic growth.

"So, you know, you deal with the environmental challenge. You make sure you keep your economy growing and you get power prices down," he said.

"That's what I'm trying to do."
