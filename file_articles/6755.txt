A British racing driver who has competed in the world famous Le Mans 24 Hours race where cars regularly pass 200mph has been ordered to attend a speed awareness course for driving 52mph on the M6 in a 50 zone.

Oliver Webb, 28, from Manchester announced on his Instagram page that he had been caught speeding in the early hours of the morning on the M6 motorway.

At the time, the 70mph limit had been reduced to 50mph and he was caught driving at 52mph.

The professional racer was driving a £125,000 Aston Martin Vantage - which is capable of reaching 195mph - when he was caught on camera.

Instead of being hit with three penalty points, he was invited to attend a speed awareness course.

Webb revealed on Instagram: 'Speed awareness course tomorrow, first one ever and for 52 in a 50 on the M6 at 3am in the truck lane.

'Nothing will get me down though, as it's finally starting to feel like Christmas.

The racer posted a selfie outside his house beside his 2019 Aston Martin Vantage ahead of attending the speed awareness course.

More than 1.4 million British motorists attend a speed awareness course which normally cost in the region of £100.

MailOnline has asked Webb's spokesperson for a comment.
