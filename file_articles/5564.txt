The incident was caught on CCTV at the White Rose service station in Wombwell, South Yorkshire.

The alleged theft, which took place on Wednesday, saw the woman steal seven milkshakes as the youngster looks on.

As the clip begins, a man is seen standing in front of a set of refrigerators with the young boy.

She quickly scans the fridges and the man points to something inside. She opens the door and begins apparently stuffing the drinks into her bag, checking over her shoulder as she does so.

The man appears to keep watch as she keeps struggles to add them to her bag, dropping one in the process.
