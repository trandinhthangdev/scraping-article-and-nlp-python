A shocked pedestrian has filmed the moment a 6ft tall and stocky kangaroo passed her on a busy bridge.

The woman was crossing the Phillip Island Bridge in Victoria when she noticed the kangaroo coming up behind her on the footpath on December 19.

As she begins to film, the massive kangaroo is waiting on the footpath before it starts hopping toward her, its nails clanking against the concrete.

The woman moves to the side and stays as still as possible as the monster kangaroo approaches, stopping only for a second before passing her by.

'So there I was crossing the Phillip island bridge on my morning walk and turned around to see the kangaroo approaching and couldn’t believe it,' she said.

'In hindsight, I probably should have gotten out of its way. But I had three options. Jump over one side 20 metres into the water, jump over the other side into the traffic or grab the phone and stick the railing as best I could.'

She said the kangaroo was at least 6ft tall.

'Holy s*** you're a big b******,' she is heard saying as the kangaroo passes her.

Seemingly undeterred, the kangaroo continues down the path toward the township.

'We just looked at each other for a split second and off it went,' she said.

The video was shared by Viral Hog and has already been viewed 15,000 times.

Social media users were able to see the comical side of the interaction.

'My buttocks woulda been hopping over da rail when I see dat beast coming towards me,' one YouTube user wrote.

'He's just on his way to the gym,' another replied.

'I woulda s*** my pants....over into the traffic for me,' another replied.
