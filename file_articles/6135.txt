Tyson Fury has taunted rival Deontay Wilder ahead of their expected rematch in February by insisting he won the original encounter and will defeat the American again.

Fury and Wilder met in Los Angeles in December 2018 as they battled it out for the WBC heavyweight championship but they could not be separated as the judges deemed it to be a draw.

The Brit believes he edged the tussle and has vowed to defeat Wilder when they are expected to rematch in Las Vegas on February 22.

Fury said: 'The big dosser says he fights all the best heavyweights but Dominic Breazeale isn't the best, and neither is Luis Ortiz.

'Breazeale is average at best and Ortiz is 145 years old, and somebody you had already knocked out.

'You fight the best, do you?

'You've only fought one good man in your career. That's me, and I beat you. Everybody in the world knows you lost to The Gypsy King.

'A Gypsy King that had been out of the ring for three years. I still beat you, on 50 per cent.

'I will beat you, dosser. I ain't afraid. I wasn't bothered about you back then, and I'm definitely not bothered now.

'You know you lost, your trainer, your manager, promoter, wife, kids, they all know The Gypsy King bettered you.'

Fury will have a new coach in his corner when he takes on Wilder as he has split from Ben Davison.

He decided to make the change just 10 weeks before his second showdown with Wilder with Javan Sugar Hill, a nephew of legendary trainer Emmanuel Steward, named as Davison's replacement.
