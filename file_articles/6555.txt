At least seven Queensland mayors have now been charged with criminal offences since the last local government elections in March 2016.

A recap of the legal dramas involving some of those charged.

SUSPENDED MORETON BAY MAYOR ALLAN SUTHERLAND

Moreton Bay Mayor Allan Sutherland has been charged with two counts of misconduct in public office. He is due to face court in February.

FORMER IPSWICH MAYOR PAUL PISASALE

Four-term Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale was charged with extortion. He was found guilty in June of posing as a private investigator to demand money from a Sydney taxi driver.

FORMER IPSWICH MAYOR ANDREW ANTONIOLLI

Antoniolli was found guilty in July of 13 fraud-related charges committed before he took over from Pisasale as mayor.

A court found he bought charity items with Ipswich council funds, to make himself look good to voters.

FORMER LOGAN MAYOR LUKE SMITH

The Queensland government sacked the entire Logan City Council in May after after a corruption probe that embroiled Mayor Luke Smith and most of the city's councillors.

On May 1, at the time he was sacked, Smith drunkenly drove into a parked car and a palm tree on his way to a KFC.

FORMER FRASER COAST MAYOR CHRIS LOFT

Former Fraser Coast mayor Chris Loft was in November found guilty of misconduct in relation to public office after a corruption probe.

A jury found Loft used his job in an attempt to secure his former campaign manager a new chief-of-staff position at the council in 2017.
