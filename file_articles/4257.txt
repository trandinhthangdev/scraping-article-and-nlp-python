Homes in three Northern towns have fallen in value over the past decade, while in some parts of London prices have doubled compared to 2010, new analysis shows.

House prices in Hartlepool, Redcar & Cleveland and Blackpool are lower than they were ten years ago.

But all of the ten areas where house prices have risen the most over the past ten years are in the South or South East, while the districts with the smallest price increases are mostly in the North, a report by modular housing developer Project Etopia shows.

The average home in Hartlepool was £115,350 ten years ago, but now it's 8 per cent cheaper at £106,381.

Redcar & Cleveland and Blackpool have seen prices fall too over the decade, although by a smaller 1 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively to £120,489 and £105,322.

On the other end of the spectrum are Thurrock in Essex, Three Rivers in Hertfordshire and Watford, which all saw the biggest increases in the last ten years, if London is excluded.

In Thurrock, the average home is currently priced at £276,164, or 76 per cent higher than in 2010, when the same home was £156,741, according to analysis of Land Registry data by modular housing developer Project Etopia.

The company compared average house prices in January 2010 and the most recently available data, from October 2019, in 346 local authority areas.

The report shows the extent of the North-South divide, explaining partly why that trend has now reversed. Currently, prices in London and the South East are either stalling or falling after year of steep increases, while they are rising in many northern areas.

Three Rivers saw prices jump from £307,791 to £539,183 in ten years - a 75 per cent increase - and nearby Watford saw a similar rise, from £201,174 to £350,614.

But some areas of London have seen the biggest hikes in the country - which is partly why prices have been declining in the capital over the past year.

Waltham Forest and Hackney - two North London districts - saw prices increase by 98 and 95 per cent respectively, meaning prices are nearly double what they were in 2010.

The average price for a home in Waltham Forest currently stands at £424,655 compared to just £214,784 ten years ago. Similarly Hackney saw prices jump from £295,824 to £577,480 over the same period.

'The staggering extremes of some of these house price increases this decade means owning a home remains an unachievable dream for many,' said Joseph Daniels of Project Etopia.

'In Three Rivers, for instance, buyers would now need mortgages of close to half a million pounds to buy an average home, leaving many properties out of reach for average earners.'

Outside London, areas like Bristol, Harlow and Dartford all saw prices increase by more than 70 per cent.

In comparison, prices in Middlesbrough and County Durham are more or less the same they were ten years ago.
