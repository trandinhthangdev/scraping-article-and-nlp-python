'B***h, I'm Santa now,' she captioned it, adding the hashtag, '#comesitonmylap'.

In the photo, the 28-year-old model is perched seductively on Santa's chair, licking her lips as she leans forward.

She's dressed in patent leather pants and black lace-up boots, which she paired with a yellow mesh crop top worn over a leopard-print bikini top.

Imogen rounded out her eclectic ensemble with a red, black and yellow ethnic-print coat, and she wore a spray-painted cowboy hat on her head.

She topped off her look with oversize tinted yellow glasses, and accessorised with layered necklaces, including a shell choker.

It was revealed Imogen had split from her longtime partner, radio shock jock Kyle Sandilands, last month.

Kyle, 48, announced his shock split from his girlfriend-of-eight-years in early November, revealing they hadn't lived together for 'quite some time'.

'We haven't been with each other for quite a few months now. Unfortunately it's run its course,' he said on The Kyle and Jackie O Show.

While Imogen has remained largely silent on the split, she took to Instagram Stories shortly after it was announced to say she and Kyle were still close.

'We have a lot to deal with separately. It's probably been one of the hardest years of our lives, separately...' she confessed.

She added: 'We still love each other very much, we speak every day. We still see each other, we deal with things with each other.'
