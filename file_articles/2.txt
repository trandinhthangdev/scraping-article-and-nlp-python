Zlatan Ibrahimovic's statue outside his former club Malmo has had the nose removed by vandals.

This is the latest damage inflicted to the monument after the Swedish striker announced he had purchased a 25 per cent stake in rival club Hammarby on November 27.

Upset supporters had previously sprayed it with paint, set it on fire and put a toilet seat over its arm.

The 3.5 metre high bronze statue was commissioned by the Swedish FA and unveiled on October 9 of this year.

Ibrahimovic's house in Stockholm was also vandalised, with 'Judas' painted on the front door amid the recriminations from his involvement with Hammarby.
