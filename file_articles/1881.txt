England's Cricket World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan and his team-mates will be recognised in the Queen's New Year honours list, according to The Sun.

The tournament hosts secured a dramatic victory over New Zealand at Lord's in July to seal a first-ever World Cup triumph.

Now Irishman Morgan, 33, will be handed a CBE as a reward for his efforts, while team-mates including Ben Stokes and vice-captain Jos Buttler are also in line for a gong.

The pair combined for a vital stand that salvaged the final, before teaming up again to score 15 vital runs in the super-over while Buttler also completed the match-winning run-out of Martin Guptill.

Stokes has already claimed the BBC Sports Personality of the Year both for his World Cup efforts and his record-breaking displays for England in this summer's drawn Ashes Test series.

Ben Stokes has enjoyed a stunning summer and may also be given an honour

With the third Test - and with it the series - seemingly lost, Stokes smashed an incredible 135 not out to seal a near-impossible win at Headingley.

A source told The Sun: 'The World Cup win was the sporting highlight of the year — not just the summer.

'Eoin captained the team to win a World Cup Final and only a handful of people have ever been able to say that.

'Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler's final Super Over has gone down in sporting folklore and is already one of the most iconic English sporting moments.

'It's only right that the joy and pride they brought to millions, not to mention the sheer professionalism and determination they showed amid such adversity, is rewarded with the highest possible honour.'
