The folklore of vampires has inspired horror stories for centuries. But the blood-sucking beings may not have been as otherworldly as we think.

For scientists believe an actual medical condition called porphyria could have inspired classic vampire tales, such as Dracula.

Porphyria, the umbrella term for eight known blood disorders, affects the body's molecular machinery for making heme.

Heme is a component of the oxygen-transporting protein, hemoglobin. When heme binds with iron, it gives blood its hallmark red color.

The different genetic variations that affect heme production give rise to different clinical presentations of porphyria.

One genetic form - erythropoietic protoporphyria - affects oxygen in the blood and makes sufferers allergic to the sun.

It is unclear how common porphyria is but figures suggest that up to one in 50,000 people are struck down with the disorder.
