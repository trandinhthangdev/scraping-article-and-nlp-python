Merry Britons braved the cold and rain last night to enjoy a festive night out on the last Saturday before Christmas.

With Christmas party season in full swing, many revellers hit the town in festive dress including Christmas jumpers, Santa outfits and reindeer costumes.

Some partygoers sheltered under umbrellas with their friends as parts of Britain were lashed by severe rain and floods on Saturday.

Saturday night's festivities followed a night of carnage on so-called 'Mad Friday', also known as 'Black Eye Friday' because of the number of accidents and fights.

The widespread bad weather didn't seem to put people off as they donned glitzy dresses and high heels for the night of drinking.
