Three men kicked, screamed and threw punches in a busy car park during their Christmas shopping trips.

A disagreement at the Belconnen Mall, in Canberra, quickly turned aggressive around midday on Sunday when a man kicked a silver Mazda.

The fight was uploaded to the Facebook group Dash Cam Owners Australia with the caption: 'So much Christmas spirit you can feel it...'

Christmas shoppers violently fought in the Belconnen Mall car park in Canberra on Sunday

The violent exchange began with a man in a colourful jacket arguing alongside the silver Mazda.

The man was furiously gesturing before he delivered a swift kick to the right hand side of the car and ran out of sight.

A man in a white long-sleeved shirt got out to chase after him and inaudible shouting and screaming could be heard from off-camera.

When the white shirted man returned to his Mazda he was followed by an argumentative older man in a red t-shirt who eventually threw a punch through the car's open window.

The video left viewers feeling confused over what had caused the altercation.

One asked: 'I don't understand why the guy kicked the car in the first place, car pulled out didn't hit anything or anyone?'

Another group member said jokingly: 'Clearly more to this video, as Pauline would say "Please explain?"'

An ACT Policing spokesperson said that they were currently investigating the car park fight.

The spokesperson said: 'Motorists are urged to take into account that the festive season is a busy time of year and people’s emotions may be heightened.'
