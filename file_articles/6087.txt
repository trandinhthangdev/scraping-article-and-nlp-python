Bayern Munich interim manager Hansi Flick has dismissed reports linking the club with Manchester City winger Leroy Sane.

The Bundesliga champions have long held an interest in the German winger, who is currently out injured until the New Year after injuring his knee in August's Community Shield.

Yet despite rumours of a £135million deal, Flick did not address the rumours when asked about Sane by reporters.

Manchester City winger Leroy Sane has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich

However Bayern interim boss Hansi Flick refused to speak about Sane when asked by reporters

'That is a player who is under contract with Manchester City and that is why it is not an issue for me at the moment,' Hansi said after Bayern's 3-1 win against Freiburg on Wednesday.

'I have to concentrate on the game on Saturday against Wolfsburg and there I have my players who were there today and maybe one or the other will be added.

'So my attention is 100 per cent on these players.'
