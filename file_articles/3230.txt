Lewis Wing added to his collection of stand out strikes to put the brakes on Stoke's bid to climb out of the Championship drop zone for the first time since August.

The midfielder - four of whose five appearances of the scoresheet last season were named as contenders for Middesbrough's goal of the season - came off the bench to find the bottom corner from 25 yards after Marcus Tavernier turned his marker Jordan Cousins to release his team-mate to decide a tense contest.

A dour match sprang to life when, eight minutes into the second-half, Sam Clucas gave the visitors the edge in the Riverside relegation battle.

Lewis Wing's thunderbolt ensured Middlesbrough came from behind to beat strugglers Stoke

City's advantage lasted just four minutes, as they paid for some hesitant defending when their back four collectively stopped expecting an offside flag as Ashley Fletcher stole in to head home a long ball punted into the area by Jonny Howson.

Potters' top scorer Clucas followed-up to find the net from 10 yards after Aynsley Pears had saved brilliantly from James McClean at point blank range when Middlesbrough were caught out by Lee Gregory's purposeful surge down the left.

Clucas was left baffled by referee Oliver Langford shortly after Fletcher's leveller, when the six-goal midfielder earned a caution for diving when he appeared to be fouled in the box by a back-tracking Howson.

The hosts' star opted to let fly from distance and his strike flashed beyond Jack Butland

The non-award was probably evened-out when Marcus Tavernier missed out on a penalty for an over-theatrical fall in the area as the midfielder appeared to be tugged back by Danny Batth.

Stoke had earlier ended a near two-and-a-half-hour wait to muster a shot on target in a contest thanks to a tame effort from Tom Ince, in a game where they knew that victory would lift them out of the bottom three.

But not for the first time this season they were unable to hang onto a lead, as Wing rewarded Boro boss Jonathan Woodgate for his positive substitutions with a confident finish past Jack Butland - the Stoke keeper who produced a fine late save to prevent Daniel Ayala from adding to the hosts' lead as the hosts recorded a fifth victory of the campaign - all of them at home.
