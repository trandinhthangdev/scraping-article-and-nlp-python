Ryan Giggs insists Gareth Bale is still in love with football and unconcerned by the criticism he attracts at Real Madrid.

Bale's commitment to Madrid has been called into question this season, and he was criticised in the Spanish press after posing with a 'Wales, golf, Madrid, in that order' banner after helping his country reach Euro 2020.

But Giggs denies that Bale's passion for the game has been affected by his experiences in Spain.

'He still very much loves the game and playing it; loves winning, loves scoring goals, loves making goals,' Giggs told Sky Sports News.

'It's all noise you can't control and it's about blocking it out so if you don't hear it then it's not going to affect you.

'Gareth (Bale) is at one of the biggest clubs in the world, he's won four Champions Leagues, he's won everything so he can handle it (the criticism).'

Bale has struggled for form and fitness at the Bernabeu this season and has scored just twice in 13 games.

There have also been reports of a falling out with manager Zinedine Zidane, who had been desperate to offload him in the summer.
