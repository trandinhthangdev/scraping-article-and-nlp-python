Cricket fans can expect to see plenty of police during the Boxing Day Test as they crack down on drunken behaviour.

As the MCG hosts the Boxing Day Test between Australia and New Zealand from Thursday, police say they will be highly visible across the CBD, Yarra and surrounding areas.

Uniformed officers will also patrol bars and pubs in Richmond, Collingwood and the Yarra area targeting those planning to "pre-load" before the cricket.

"We encourage fans to flock to the ground in large numbers to witness cricket's Trans-Tasman rivalry first-hand, but ask that you do so responsibly," Acting Assistant Commissioner Tim Hansen said on Monday.

"While police will be closely monitoring the responsible service of alcohol, it's up to everyone to think about their own sensible consumption of alcohol - especially when spending a warm day in the outer."

Up to 200,000 people will pass through the gates of the 'G over the course of the test.

Mr Hansen said stadium management has the right to evict punters deemed excessively under the influence of alcohol.

Police will also be out and about at other events including Carols by Candlelight, when 50,000 concertgoers are expected at Sidney Myer Music Bowl for the annual Christmas eve event.

Revellers are encouraged to use public transport to get in and out of the city as road closures will be in place.
