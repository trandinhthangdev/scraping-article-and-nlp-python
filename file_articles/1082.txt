Getting fully into the festive spirit, one driver has certainly found a novel way to spread joy to fellow commuters - by covering their car in thousands of twinkling Christmas lights.

The unusual sight was spotted during a stop at a service station in Raynes Park, London.

After filling up, the black Land Rover - which even sported LED lights along its high aerial - pulled out of the service station and joined the A3 to London.

The vibrant 4x4 might well be the best-decorated festive vehicle on the roads in the UK, though its certainly not the only one to have attracted attention from surprised road users.

In 2017, a young motorist from Canberra, Australia, spent 40 hours attaching 20,000 fairy lights to his Hyundai Santa Fe.

Jordan Wallace had previously placed 10,000 lights on his Holden Astra in 2016 and told Daily Mail Australia that he was inspired by a similar car he saw during Christmas as a child.

'When I was younger there was a ute that used to drive around my suburb with a light-up reindeer in the tray,' he said.

'I really wanted to take that spirit to the next level hence the Christmas Car was born.'

As for the best decorated house, homeowners in Haughton, Staffordshire are claiming that title, after more than 100 properties were recently decked out with around 10,000 lights.

Neighbours clubbed together to transform their entire village into a twinkling winter wonderland to raise thousands of pounds for charity.

Visitors have been flocking to the rural village to see the festive illuminations donating over £5,000 so far to several charities, as well as the local church and school.
