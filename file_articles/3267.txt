Paris Saint-Germain are in talks with Juventus over a swap deal for Emre Can, which could see Leandro Paredes move to Turin.

Can looks set to leave in January after falling out of favour since Maurizio Sarri took the helm in the summer and has made just seven appearances this season.

PSG, meanwhile, are keen to add a more physical midfielder to their squad and RMC reports they are discussing a straight swap deal for the 25-year-old.

PSG are short of funds and have offered Leandro Paredes as a potential makeweight

Can has made just seven appearances for Juve this season under new boss Maurizio Sarri

The Ligue 1 side are short of transfer funds as they negotiate a bumper new deal for Kylian Mbappe and have put forward Leandro Paredes as a potential makeweight.

Paredes joined PSG 12 months ago in a January move from Zenit Saint-Petersburg but has made just 20 appearances for the club since his move to France.

Can, meanwhile, has been linked with several clubs in Europe, after seeing his route to first team football blocked by Juve's plethora of midfield options.

Can signed a four-year deal with Juve when he joined the club on a free from Liverpool in 2018

Aaron Ramsey joined the club from Arsenal in the summer, while Adrien Rabiot, Miralem Pjanic, Sami Khedira and Blaise Matuidi are all ahead of him in the pecking order.

Can joined Juve on a free transfer in June 2018 and signed a four-year deal after running down his contract at Liverpool.

As a result, the Bianconeri may still hold out for a transfer fee for the Germany international, who has three years remaining on his current contract.

Can has made 44 appearances since his move to Turin, scoring four goals, and won the Serie A title last season.
