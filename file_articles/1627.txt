Smoke from the Adelaide Hills bushfire had dropped the city's air quality rating to poor.

The Environment Protection Authority says air quality readings are improving but parts of the hills and metropolitan area remain affected by bushfire smoke.

The situation on Sunday was further exacerbated by an early morning temperature inversion layer which kept smoke low to the ground.

The EPA said anyone with health issues or concerns should stay inside with windows and doors closed.

A watch and act warning remains in place for the blaze, with the Country Fire Service reporting some renewed fire activity within the 127-kilometre perimeter.

The fire has burnt through more than 25,000 hectares and destroyed at least 15 homes.

Before it was sparked on Friday, the Bureau of Meteorology also reported that smoke from the NSW bushfires had made its way to Adelaide.
