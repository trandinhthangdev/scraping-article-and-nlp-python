She was surrounded by white sand and other beach-goers, the stunning aqua blue ocean visible behind her.

'This must be the place,' she captioned the photo.

While Bridget happily flaunted her bikini body in the photo, she's previously confessed to having been body shamed by the modelling industry.

In a post on her blog, Bridget Malcolm Official, in March last year, the Aussie beauty recounted what she described as 'awful experiences' through her work.

'It is hard to articulate just how awful the feeling is when you are on a set and everyone there hates the way you look,' she wrote.

She said it has taught her never to judge others based on their appearance.

'After my experiences of body shaming whilst modeling (and this is one of many) I will never, EVER shame another woman on how she looks,' she added.

'Or man for that matter. But women have enough s**t to put up with - we should be celebrating each other wherever we happen to be at.'
