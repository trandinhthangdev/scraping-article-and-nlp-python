Bordeaux have joined Inter Milan in the race to sign Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud.

The Ligue 1 side are interested in a loan deal for the 33-year-old, who has been given the go-ahead to leave in January, according to Goal.

Giroud is interested in a reunion with former Blues boss Antonio Conte at Inter, although he could face a similar problem in getting playing time with Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez in top form for the Serie A title challengers.

Didier Deschamps has urged Giroud to leave Chelsea to secure a spot in France's Euro 2020 squad.

Giroud started up-front in every game except the tournament opener as Deschamps guided France to World Cup glory in 2018, and he has continued to be the favoured striker in qualifying for the 2020 European championships.

It has been a different story at Chelsea - the 33-year-old he struggling to convince Conte, Mauricio Sarri and Frank Lampard in his three seasons - starting just 15 Premier League games and coming on as a substitute 30 times.

This season things have got worse for the Frenchman, with Lampard granting him only 208 minutes so far - putting his France future in danger.

'Giroud, like others, may have to move,' Deschamps said. 'His situation at Chelsea hasn't changed in two months.

'It would be better for him, of course, to go to a club where he would get more playing time. If he can't get it at Chelsea, the idea is to get it elsewhere.'
