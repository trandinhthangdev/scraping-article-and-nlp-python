LSU's Ed Orgeron was named the recipient of the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year Award on Friday, the Football Writers Association of America announced.

Orgeron has guided the top-ranked Tigers to a 13-0 record entering their College Football Playoff semifinal matchup with No. 4 Oklahoma on Dec. 28. LSU is led by Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Joe Burrow.

"Coach Orgeron is an incredibly deserving winner of this prestigious honor," FWAA President Matt Fortuna said in a statement. "From the ways he has reinvented his program on and off the field, to the bonds he has formed with his players, it is easy to see how he has led LSU to a No. 1 ranking this season. Joe Burrow's Heisman speech alone made me want to run through a brick wall for Coach O."

Orgeron is the third LSU coach to win the Eddie Robinson award. The others are Paul Dietzel (1958) and Nick Saban (2003) and both those coaches went on to win the national championship in those seasons.

This season's other finalists were Ohio State's Ryan Day, former Appalachian State coach Eliah Drinkwitz, SMU's Sonny Dykes, Minnesota's P.J. Fleck, Boise State's Bryan Harsin, former Memphis coach Mike Norvell, Baylor's Matt Rhule and Clemson's Dabo Swinney.

"Coach Ed Orgeron and the LSU Tigers' impressive 13-0 regular season record is a testament to Coach O's relentless leadership and guidance of one of college football's most storied programs," said Eddie Robinson III, grandson of the legendary coach. "Congratulations Coach Orgeron from the Robinson Family on winning the 2019 'Eddie'!"

Eddie Robinson went 408-165-15 in 56 seasons at Grambling, a historically black program. He was inducted into the College Hall of Fame in 1997 and died in 2007 at age 88.
