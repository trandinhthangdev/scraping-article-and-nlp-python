The average house price in major cities has risen by nearly £90,000 in the past decade, research shows.

This is an increase of 54 per cent, according to housing website Zoopla, which looked at the 20 biggest cities.

At an average rise of £89,987, this is also greater than the average uplift across the whole of the country in the period, which comes in at £62,218.

In London, average prices surged by £204,400, or 74 per cent, in the decade, while in Bristol they were up by £115,000, or 68 per cent.

Properties in Cambridge also soared by £167,800, or 67 per cent. The typical house price across the 20 cities covered is now £257,200, while in London it is £479,000.

Looking forward, Richard Donnell, of Zoopla, said: ‘Lower mortgage rates have been reflected in higher house prices, which means prices are set to rise at a lower rate in future, more in line with average earnings.

‘We expect UK city house prices to rise by 3 per cent over 2020.’
