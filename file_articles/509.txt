Air quality across Adelaide has fallen to hazardous levels because of smoke from the bushfires in the Adelaide Hills, the Environment Protection Authority says.

It says pollution levels in the city are two to six times normal levels.

Adelaide's CBD peaked at 200 micrograms of PM 10 particles, (particles up to 10 micrograms across) early on Monday.

The normal level is 50 micrograms.

But in suburban Kensington levels rose to 350 micrograms.

EPA boss Keith Baldry said the smoke haze was the result of evening gully winds pushing smoke from the fire ground combined with calm conditions and an inversion layer that trapped the smoke overnight.

Air quality in the Adelaide metropolitan area is likely to improve on Monday afternoon before the haze returns overnight.

SA Health said the smoke could pose a health risk, particularly for people with lung or heart conditions.

"Hot weather and poor air quality are a dangerous combination and we are urging people to stay indoors, stay hydrated and reduce their exposure to smoky air," acting chief public health officer Chris Lease said.

"Smoke particles can aggravate existing health problems such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma and heart conditions."
