Donovan Mitchell scored 30 points, including a reverse layup that put Utah ahead down the stretch, and helped the visiting Jazz to a 111-106 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday.

Atlanta had tied the game at 99-99 when Kevin Huerter drained a 3-pointer with 5:03 left, but Mitchell scored after Royce O'Neale rebounded a missed shot by Atlanta's Trae Young and started the other way. Mitchell's go-ahead basket came with 3:46 left and the Jazz outscored the Hawks 12-7 to end the game. Utah outscored Atlanta 28-22 in the final quarter.

The win was the fourth straight for Utah. Atlanta suffered its sixth straight loss.

It was the eighth 30-point game for Mitchell, the most on the club. He was 12-for 22 from the field, only one of them a 3-pointer, and added five rebounds and five assists. Mitchell is averaging 28 points over the last five games and has scored 30 in the last two games.

The Jazz also got 20 points and 13 rebounds from Rudy Gobert, who has had double-figure rebounds in three of the last four games. Bojan Bogdanovic added 19 points and nine rebounds and Joe Ingles scored 14.

Atlanta got 30 points from Young, who was playing with a right thigh contusion. Young was only 9-for-28 from the field, but added eight assists. It was his 12th game with at least 30 points.

Jabari Parker scored 23 points, 11 in the first period, and had nine rebounds. Huerter scored 17 and rookie Cam Reddish added 14 points.

The Hawks led 30-28 after one quarter and 56-52 at the half behind 15 from Young.

Atlanta's Vince Carter moved into fourth place on the NBA's career list with 1,505 games.

Atlanta plays again on Saturday at Brooklyn. Utah plays the second game of its three-game road trip on Saturday at Charlotte.
