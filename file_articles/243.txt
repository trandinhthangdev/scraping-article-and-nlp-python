Gareth Southgate believes the future is bright for England as we head into the New Year.

The Three Lions boss told Sky Sports News: 'We expected to win our [qualification] group but I think the way that we played and the way we took apart those lower-ranked teams. I don't think we could have done any more than we did.

'There is a lot for people to get excited about, our internal expectations are high.

'Of course we want the fans to be excited, I don't want to take away that hope and excitement.'

Southgate has recently discussed one dark point for the national team which Sportsmail broke that Joe Gomez and Raheem Sterling had clashed in the canteen at St George's Park, which left Gomez with a large scar that stretched from his cheek down to his neck.

Now, as he reflects on another successful year as England boss, Southgate claims that no team is perfect and his Three Lions squad reacted in the right way.

'No journey of a team is ever going to be smooth and seamless,' Southgate told the FA.

'I think those moments of difficulty are really where you find out about people and really you then have a chance as a group to react in one way or another.

'You can either fold and things can fall apart a bit, or you can react in the right way.

'Some of those challenges in Montenegro and Bulgaria were broader than just football and we knew there was an opportunity to perhaps make a difference in wider society.

'But also, they were an important moment for us as a team, that everybody felt supported and everybody felt the team were united in what they were going to do. We definitely got to that stage as the year went through.'
