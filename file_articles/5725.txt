A man in China is under investigation after driving his car in circle at a junction over and over again because he said he found it too hard to cope with stress.

The motorist drove his Mercedes-Benz at a high speed as it spun around the crossroad for more than 10 minutes, ignoring the passing traffic, police said.

He told officers that he had been under great pressure and was hoping to relieve anxiety through the act.
