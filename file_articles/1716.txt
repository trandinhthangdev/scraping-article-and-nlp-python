Nina Agdal is known for her numerous appearances in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.

But the Danish model was a little more modest on Saturday, as she bundled up in NYC under a bright orange puffer jacket.

She seemed busy and on the go as she hit the city with AirPods in and her phone in hand.

Nina, 27, paired the bright thigh-length coat with medium wash straight-cut jeans and black heeled booties.

For more color in her look, the swimsuit model strapped a bight blue and yellow purse across her chest.

She multitasked, walking and using her phone down the sidewalk.

Nina seemed to rock a natural, fresh face of makeup with her brows perfectly shaped.

Her hair was wrapped up tight into a bun for the outing.

She did go solo for the night with her beau Jack Brinkley Cook missing.

Speaking to Us Weekly in Septmber, she said that while their relationship wasn't perfect, there was a lot of love.

'No relationship is perfect, but I think we just have a really sincere love for each other, and we support each other, we respect each other and we just love each other!'
