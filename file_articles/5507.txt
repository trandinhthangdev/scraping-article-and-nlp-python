The Houston Cougars must vacate three wins from the 2018 football season due to academic misconduct.

According to an NCAA report released Wednesday, a former tutor in the athletic department wrote four papers for two unnamed players in exchange for $205 over a period of about six weeks.

Because one of those players competed in games while ineligible due to the academic misconduct, the Cougars' official record that season under former coach Major Applewhite drops from 8-5 to 5-8.

Dana Holgorsen now is Houston's coach.

The Division I Committee on Infractions also found NCAA rules violations by the school's volleyball program involving excessive practice time.

The NCAA put the school on one year of probation and Houston self-imposed a fine of $5,000.
