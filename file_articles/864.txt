A 36-hour fish market frenzy has kicked off in Sydney, as shoppers scramble for their Christmas seafood staples.

The Sydney Fish Market opened at 5am on Monday and will not close again until 5pm on Tuesday.

Market spokeswoman Stephanie Margrain says about 100,000 people are expected to buy 700 tonnes of seafood, including 130 tonnes of prawns.

"Prawns and oysters are always favourites at Christmas time and people will be glad to know that supply is plentiful for both of those items and prices are comparable to last year."

Fellow market spokesman Alex Stollznow says shoppers should look at the eyes of fish to determine how fresh they are.

"The eyes of a fish should be clear and full.

"If it looks nice it probably is, but a closer inspection for seafood is always recommended. If you smell it and it's bad on the nose, then that seafood is not fresh and steer clear of it."
