Firefighters broke down in tears as they laid flowers and paid tributes on Friday to their two mates killed battling a blaze near Sydney.

Volunteers Andrew O'Dwyer, 36, and Geoffrey Keaton, 32, were killed on Thursday evening when their truck rolled off the road after hitting a fallen tree at Buxton, south of Sydney.

Their colleagues were seen sharing embraces and wiping away tears at Horsley Park Rural Fire Brigade in Sydney on Friday.

Mr O'Dwyer and Mr Keaton, who were both fathers, had been fighting fires for more than a decade and were remembered as heroes by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who is in Hawaii on holiday.

'They were bravely defending their communities with an unmatched spirit and a dedication that will forever set them apart amongst our most courageous Australians,' Mr Morrison said in a statement.

'Their sacrifice and service saving lives and saving properties will be forever remembered. I wish those injured all the best in their recovery.'

Just hours before his death Mr O'Dwyer - a father-of-three - shared a video of him and a colleague battling a blaze.

Mr Keaton had risen to the role of deputy captain after joining the Horsley Park RFS brigade in 2006.

Both Mr O'Dwyer and Mr Keaton - who had a son - were less than a week out from Christmas with their families.

Mr Keaton had a son Harvey with his partner Jess and Mr O'Dwyer had a daughter, Charlotte, both aged 19 months old and born just two days apart.

Colleagues of the firefighters lowered the station's flags to half mast and laid out their helmets in an emotional tribute.

On the night of Mr Keaton's death, his father John was fighting a mega blaze in Gospers Mountain northwest of Sydney - while his son was at the Green Wattle Creek Fire.

RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reports on Friday: 'There is a definition of hero out there and these two absolutely line up to it and we owe it to honour them and remember them,' he said

'I understand they were a pretty tight-knit group,' RFS deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said on Friday morning.

'This is quite a tight brigade and that will impact significantly on that group.

'Everybody feels for these people and their families... people have got to try and put that aside and keep going.'

RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reports on Friday: 'There is a definition of hero out there and these two absolutely line up to it and we owe it to honour them and remember them,' he said.

The deaths had shocked the RFS 'to the core', Mr Fitzsimmons said.

'They're ordinary, everyday individuals - like you and I - that go out and simply want to serve and protect and make a difference in their local community and they don't ever go out in the knowledge that they might not come home from that shift,' he said.

In an emotion fueled tribute, volunteer firefighters wiped away tears and comforted one another as they mourn Mr Keaton and Mr O'Dwyer

Mr Fitzsimmons said the wives of the fallen firefighters were in 'extraordinary shock and despair'.

'They are at a loss,' he said.

'They're in extraordinary shock and natural despair at the enormity of what's confronting them and to try and comprehend the tragedy that's unfolded.'

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian met with the firefighters after the loss of Mr O'Dwyer and Mr Keaton and said it was an 'honour' to spend time with them.

'Not only do we express our deepest sympathy to the families of heroes Geoff and Andrew, but our thoughts are also with their extended family- the Horsley Park RFS brigade,' she tweeted.

'These two brave young men who lost their lives represent, for us, the thousands and thousands of volunteers on the ground today and tomorrow and in the days coming who put their own life, their own safety on the line to protect others,' Ms Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.

A GoFundMe page has been started for their families and the RFS have also set up a dedicated bank account to collect donations for their relatives.

Three other firefighters who were in the truck with Mr O'Dwyer and Mr Keaton were rushed to hospital but survived with non-life threatening injuries.

Firefighters in the Blue Mountains are meanwhile desperately battling to contain a blaze - which on Friday crossed the Bells Line of Road - burning near the outskirts of the town of Bilpin

In Balmoral and the neighbouring town of Bargo, NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said 20 homes have been destroyed, while another 20 were lost in Buxton

In a separate incident, two firefighters were placed in induced comas after being overrun by flames at Bargo, while another three were injured.

A 56-year-old man suffering burns to his face and legs and a 28-year-old woman with burns to her face both had to be airlifted to Concord Hospital in 'serious conditions'.

It's feared some 40 homes were lost in Buxton, Balmoral, Bargo and surrounding areas on Thursday, as the Green Wattle Creek blaze tore through the Wollondilly Shire.

That blaze remained at emergency warning level early on Friday, along with the huge Gospers Mountain fire in the north-west of Sydney.

The neighbouring Kerry Ridge blaze and a fire on the NSW South Coast at Currowan were downgraded to a 'watch and act' alert.

Conditions worsened on Friday which was expected to eclipse the hottest day on record for a third consecutive day.

A searing heatwave combined with 100km/h winds fuel one of the nation's worst ever bushfire crisis.

Melbourne temperatures nudged 44C on Friday, while temperatures in Adelaide reached 46C - toppling the record set on Thursday for the city's hottest December day.

Sydney had a brief relief in temperatures on Friday but the mercury was forecast to soar back up to 42C on Saturday as the wall of heat hovering over Australia continues to send records tumbling.

The soaring heat could mean Friday's national average maximum temperature would end up even higher than Tuesday's record-breaking 40.7C and Wednesday's 41.9C.

'It is possible that record … may continue to be broken for the next couple of days,' Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Kimba Wong told The Courier Mail.

Firefighters were bracing for a disastrous end to the week, with the New South Wales Southern Highlands region already reeling from the loss of at least 40 homes to the Green Wattle Creek Fire, which continues to burn out of control.

The blaze, 150km south-west of Sydney, as well as the Gospers Mountain mega fire, are both burning at an emergency warning level - while more than 100 other fires burn across the state.

But Queensland's Fire and Emergency Service have warned they will be in no position to send in reinforcements to their southern neighbours as they too face worsening bushfire conditions in the surging heat.

A severe fire warning has been issued for the Darling Downs and Granite Belt, the Central Highlands and Coalfields for Friday and Sunday while the rest of the state remains at high and very high danger levels.

The record-breaking temperatures in South Australia also resulted in dangerous fires on Friday.

Two fires - one on the northern outskirts of the city around Angle Vale - and another in the Adelaide Hills around Lobethal saw properties destroyed.

In the afternoon, an emergency was declared around the town of Maitland and surrounding areas on the Yorke Peninsula.

The potentially record-breaking day could see Melbourne tip 44C on the thermostat on Friday, while the temperature in Adelaide has been predicted to reach 46C

Nullarbor broke the record for the hottest-ever December day when it hit 49.9C on Thursday afternoon, while Ceduna on the Eyre Peninsula recorded its hottest day in more than 80 years at 48.8C.

The 48C-plus heat in Port Augusta was so extreme this week the city's council said four of its roads were already showing 'signs of bleeding' as the bitumen began to melt under the searing temperatures.

The 46C forecast in Melbourne would mean the city could sweat through its hottest day since Black Saturday in 2009, when the temperature reached 46.4C.

Melbourne Yarra Trams has also advised that services will be altered on Friday to cater for the heat, given the potential for significant disruptions to services.

Emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp asked Victorians to be bushfire ready.

'If you leave when you see the fires, it might be too late,' Mr Crisp said.

'It will be a tough and challenging day for the state. We're doing everything we can, what are you doing?'

Forty fires have been burning across Victoria this week, with more than 50,000 hectares of land scorched by four fires in Gippsland in the past month.

A front moving across Western Australia is expected to bring an end in sight to this week's heatwave by this weekend, with the cool change arriving in NSW in time for Christmas.

Friday's national average maximum temperature even higher than Tuesday's record-breaking 40.7C and Wednesday's 41.9C (pictured German tourists Julia Wasmiller (L) and Jessica Pryor pose at Mrs Macquarie's Chair in Sydney, wearing face masks due to heavy smoke)

NSW RFS captain Jon Russell said he thought he was going to die as his crew were trapped in their melting fire truck by a sharp change in wind direction.

'As I got out of the driver's seat, they came back screaming ''Get back in the truck get back in the truck'',' he said told The Daily Telegraph.

'We stuck hard up against the garage because it was the only thing I could see… it was unbelievable the speed that moved at. Of all the days I have been a firefighter, today is the only day I thought it would be my last.'

Balmoral - home to about 700 people in the New South Wales Southern Highlands - and several other tiny towns were ravaged by the 149,000 hectare megafire early on Thursday afternoon.

The devastating blazes have prompted NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian to declare a state of emergency for the next seven days and urged any travellers to reassess their holiday plans.

'As bad as conditions are today, Saturday is going to be worse,' NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Thursday afternoon.

'If you are told a road is closed, if you are told not to travel please take the advice, this is a state of emergency, we don't take it lightly.

'It's normally a special time of the year, but we are under extreme circumstance and we just need everybody to listen to the warnings.'

Residents watched on as the out-of-control bushfire near Bargo sent thick plumes of smoke into the sky

The Bureau of Meteorology said the worst is still yet to come with a slight relief in temperatures on Friday before an 'exceptionally hot air mass' blasts New South Wales on Saturday.

'Saturday has the potential to be a very challenging day for NSW and ACT residents, with ­severe to extreme heatwave conditions, deteriorating air quality and gusty wind changes which will lead to dangerous fire con­ditions,' meteorologist Andre Peace told The Daily Telegraph.

In Balmoral and the neighbouring town of Bargo, authorities said 20 homes have been destroyed, while another 20 were lost in Buxton.

One woman who was loading horses into a float as she fled Bargo - where at least six homes have been lost - said both her animals and residents of the town were 'in panic mode'.

'Property can be saved but it's life that can,' she told 9News.

Even more crushing for the firefighters battling to keep the bushfires under control was the fact many of them lost their own homes to the blazes.

'They're absolutely shattered - they are devastated by loss but it goes that little further when it's your own home or the colleague you've got sitting on the fire truck next to you,' NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Illawarra Mercury.

Adding to the headaches for fire fighters was a southerly change on Thursday which pushed the blaze towards southern Sydney suburbs including Tahmoor.

Residents in Tahmoor, Pheasants Nest, Buxton, Couridjah, Thirlmere, Bargo, Balmoral and Yanderra were told it was too late to leave.

The mayor of Wollondilly Shire Matthew Deeth said the situation was 'as serious as it gets'.

'Our evacuation centre at Picton Bowling Club is at capacity and our RFS volunteers are stretched incredibly thin,' he told The Australian.

300 people were on Thursday night sheltering inside RSL clubs at Piction and nearby Mittagong.

One resident said they were shocked the fire had reached suburbia - with the collection of small towns less than 50km away from Campbelltown on Sydney's south-western fringe.

By 7pm on Thursday evening, the state's Rural Fire Service extended the same warning to the towns of Newnes Junction, Dargan and Clarence in the Blue Mountains.

Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told media the fire was growing at such a rapid rate that it was currently hard to get exact details on properties lost.

'I suspect we're probably talking in the vicinity of dozens. What that is in terms of homes, sheds, facilities, I just simply don't have that detail at this stage,' he said.

'It's too fast and unfolding as we speak.'

'We just do not have the capacity to send people to help at the moment,' a Queensland Fire and Emergency Service spokesman said.

'In fact, we may have to seek help from other states if conditions worsen in Queensland.'

Saturday is expected to bring the worst of the conditions, with 3000 firefighters already rostered on.

Conditions are also worsening at Currowan, on the NSW South Coast, where at 3pm a fire was upgraded to watch and act stage.

Earlier on Thursday, Ms Berejiklian declared a state of emergency, as temperatures in Sydney's far west hit 45C and 39C in Sydney's CBD.

There are concerns the Gospers Mountain fire, ravaging the northern end of the Blue Mountains National Park, could meet the Green Wattle Creek blaze to the south.

Firefighters battled in vain to stop the fire from jumping the Bells Line of Road at Berambing - which runs east to west through the national park.

'It roared over the road, destroying power lines and cutting the various Fire Brigade resources in half stuck on either side of the fire,' The Sydney Morning Herald reported from the scene.

The Blue Mountains train line has been closed in its outer-western stretch between Lithgow and Mount Victoria as a fire threatens the rail corridor in between the two stations at Bell.

Those in the town of Bilpin, meanwhile, are bracing for the fire to reach their homes.

During a press conference, the NSW Premier said the 'decision to declare a state of emergency is not taken lightly.

'You only declare states of emergency when it's absolutely necessary and on expert advice from commissioners,' Ms Berejiklian said.

It is the second state of emergency she has declared since the start of this year's horror bushfire season. Six people have died and more than 800 homes have been lost.

Ms Berejiklian said they weren't expecting conditions to be as catastrophic as they were during the previous state of emergency on November 11.

Prior to the November 11 declaration, NSW had not faced a state of emergency since October 2013.

The announcement relinquishes decision making powers from the NSW government and allows Commissioner Fitzsimmons more control over his team of firefighters.

For the next seven days during the state of emergency, he has the ability to control and coordinate the allocation of government resources, close roads and evacuate residents.

This marks just the fifth state of emergency declared since 2006.

The floods in 2012, both in Queensland and NSW, warranted an emergency warning, as did bushfires in October 2013.

Other natural disasters, including the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009, didn't result in an emergency warning.

What does a state of emergency mean? Declaring a state of emergency relinquishes decision making powers from the NSW government and allows RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons more control over his team of firefighters. For the next seven days during the state of emergency, can now control and coordinate the allocation of government resources, close roads and evacuate residents. Ms Fitzsimmons now has the ability to: Control and coordinate the allocation of government resources Evacuate people from property within declared areas Close roads and thoroughfares to traffic Pull down or shore up infrastructure at risk of collapse Shut down utilities in the declared area including electricity, gas, oil and water Enter or take possession of property for emergency response NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian held a press conference held on Thursday morning, where she said the 'decision to declare a state of emergency is not taken lightly. 'You only declare states of emergency when it's absolutely necessary and on expert advice from commissioners.'
