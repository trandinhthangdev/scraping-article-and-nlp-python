Gary Neville insists he does not trust Paul Pogba's agent Mino Raiola after he claimed the Manchester United midfielder wants to win trophies with the club.

The Red Devils midfielder played his first game in nearly three months on Sunday when he came off the bench in a 2-0 defeat by rock bottom Watford.

Pogba had been suffering with an ankle problem since September, and was also struck down by illness last week.

Neville told Sky Sports after the match at Vicarage Road: 'That's good. That's great news.

'Ultimately, I look forward to him being at the club for the next two or three years.

'If he is, I'll be delighted because a flying, fit, motivated and committed Paul Pogba is a massive asset to Manchester United.

'But I don't believe a word his agent says. I don't believe a word that comes out of that man's mouth.'

Neville was referring to Raiola telling The Telegraph: 'I think that Paul really went home.

'Paul could have gone elsewhere. But he really chose with his heart, to go home. Paul is a very, very nice person.

'Paul wants to be successful and happy and wants to win prizes and he would love to do that with Manchester United.'

The French World Cup winner has been heavily linked with the exit door at Old Trafford for the last year, with United dropping out of the Champions League and failing to challenge for the trophies Pogba craves.

Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane was keen to sign him last summer, but the Spanish giants were unable to meet United's £150million valuation.
