The head of a powerful West Australian parliamentary committee has hit back at corruption investigators over claims she is impeding a probe into the misuse of taxpayer funds.

Legislative Council president Kate Doust has been urged by the Corruption and Crime Commission and her own Labor colleagues, including Premier Mark McGowan, to hand back a laptop seized from disgraced Liberal MP Phil Edman.

In a statement on Thursday, Ms Doust said the powerful Procedures and Privileges Committee which she chairs "supports the important work of the CCC" and is working to release materials to investigators as soon as practicable.
