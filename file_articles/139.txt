Thibaut Courtois believes Karim Benzema is capable of carrying Real Madrid this season.

The 32-year-old has struck the back of the net 16 times this season in 23 appearances in all competitions.

But Courtois has admitted that Los Blancos do miss Cristiano Ronaldo.

The former Chelsea goalkeeper said: 'You talk about a man who scored 40-50 goals a year, you can miss him.

'But he left a year and a half ago, we have players who can score goals too. Bad luck and good goalkeepers, it's a bit of everything at the moment.

'I don't have an explanation for why the ball doesn't want to go in, but I trust that my team-mates can score at any time.

'Karim is outstanding, he has scored a lot of goals already. I don't think a signing is necessary, I fully trust the team.'

The draw against Bilbao meant Real Madrid lost ground in the title race as they sit two points off leaders Barcelona.
