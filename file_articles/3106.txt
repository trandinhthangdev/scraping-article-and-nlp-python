George Ford has agreed a new two-year deal with Leicester, keeping the England fly-half at Welford Road until the summer of 2022.

Bristol had attempted to lure the 26-year-old, but Ford — who would have been out of contract at the end of this season — has opted to stay with the Tigers, who are expected to announce the deal next week.

Keeping hold of one of the country's leading players, who has already won 65 Test caps, is a coup for Leicester, who are believed to have finalised terms for their young England prop Ellis Genge to stay beyond this season.

But Ben Youngs and Jonny May are also coming towards the end of their current deals, with persistent speculation that the latter may leave the Tigers next summer.

Meanwhile, Wales full-back Liam Williams will leave Saracens at the end of this campaign to return to the Scarlets.
