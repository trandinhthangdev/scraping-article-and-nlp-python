It's the festive ghost story that everyone has a soft spot for - and has been adapted over a hundred times for film, TV and theatre.

But the BBC's newest adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic A Christmas Carol has been slammed by viewers for tampering with the traditional dialogue - after lead character Ebeneezer Scrooge [played by Guy Pearce] dropped the F-bomb.

Those tuning into episode one of the three-part drama found the sudden expletive out of place in the story - which is set in Dickensian London.

Not impressed: The BBC's newest adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic A Christmas Carol has been slammed by viewers for tampering with the traditional dialogue - after lead character Ebeneezer Scrooge [played by Guy Pearce, pictured] dropped the F-bomb

'Dear @BBC if you have great source material #TheWarofTheWorlds #AChristmasCarol don't f**k it up by altering to the story. Also don't add "f**k" to the script to make it appear more grownup and edgy,' one person typed on Twitter, also referencing their adaptation of H. G. Wells' The War Of The Worlds, which the BBC tackled earlier this year.

Another added: 'I turned over when Scrooge / Mike from Neighbours said f**k. And I'm proper sweary!'

'Congratulations to the writer, director and producers of #AChristmasCarol for taking a work of perfection and making it completely soulless and unwatchable. To f**k something up that badly takes real talent,' another posted.

Followed by: 'If it hadn't actually been called #AChristmasCarol, I doubt anyone would have objected in quite the same way. It could, quite rightly, have been a stand alone drama. But, to specifically advertise & call it a dramatisation of Dickens' story, is a travesty.'

Someone else posted: 'Spectacularly dreadful. Terrible CGI, terrible acting, horrible colours, ridiculous, unnecessary dialogue, obnoxious modern styling. Won't be watching next two episodes.'

'Scrooge has an Ozzie accent, Marley has a silly sub-plot and it's sprinkled with effing & jeffing. It's so slow paced, we switched over to Dick & Angel on Ch4. Sorry. BBC, we ain't impressed,' someone else tweeted.

'Bitterly disappointed. Scrooge wouldn’t say this. Crachit wouldn’t say any of this. And stop swearing,' penned another.

Some liked the show, however. One posted: 'LOVING #AChristmasCarol on @BBCOne. Never before enjoyed the story of Scrooge, but this one has me hooked! Cannot wait for tomorrow’s episode!'

If it ain't broke: 'Dear @BBC if you have great source material #TheWarofTheWorlds #AChristmasCarol don't f**k it up by altering to the story. Also don't add "f**k" to the script to make it appear more grownup and edgy,' one person typed on Twitter

Oh my! It shocked fans from the off, opening with a scene in which a young boy urinates on the grave of Jacob Marley, calling him 'a skinflint b*****d'

Someone else posted: 'Those complaining about any adaptations certainly don’t go to the Theatre #dear - Shakespeare is adapted 1000’s of times - stop being anal - and btw - f**king was a popular Victorian swear word.'

The mini-series has been written by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight.

Slammed: Many took to Twitter to express what they felt about the added bad language used in the series

This version of the story is the first major adaptation of the classic seasonal tale to be considered unsuitable for children - screened at the 9PM watershed.

Claire Tomalin, who wrote a celebrated biography of Dickens, said: 'I don’t think he would have been very pleased. Dickens didn’t need people urinating on graves. He reached people through the power of his words and his imagination.'

The new drama, billed as one of the highlights of the BBC’s Christmas schedule - which was also widely panned when it was announced - is a far cry from the classic 1951 feature film version featuring Alastair Sim, which remains popular with family audiences.

Others also tweeted about the poor sound quality and 'muffled' acting - which is often a complaint made about BBC broadcasts.

Expletive! Starring Australian Pearce as Scrooge, one scene has Scrooge complaining about a din outside, asking: 'How am I supposed to work with all this f*****g noise?'

Starring Australian Pearce as Scrooge, Line Of Duty star Stephen Graham as Jacob Marley and Andy Serkis as the ghost of Christmas Past, one scene has Scrooge complaining about a din outside, asking: 'How am I supposed to work with all this f*****g noise?'

The F-word features again when Marley’s ghost complains that he is unable to escape everlasting damnation.

But the show’s cast have tried to justify their version of the Christmas classic, published first in 1843, which will be shown over three consecutive nights.

Also starring: Actor Joe Alwyn is transformed into Scrooge's underpaid clerk Bob Cratchit for the three-part series. It is screened at the 9PM watershed

TV star: A Christmas Carol's Tiny Tim star Lenny Rush, 10, who has a rare form of dwarfism, has revealed that he hopes his appearance on the BBC series will inspire other people with disabilities

In an interview with the Financial Times, Pearce said: 'I have seen a couple of versions of A Christmas Carol – there’s always something a little cosy about it. Whereas this one is really confronting, it’s really heartbreaking, it’s really devastating, it’s really emotional.'

Charlotte Riley plays the ghost of Christmas Present as Scrooge’s sister rather than as the traditional Father Christmas figure.

She told the BBC’s One Show that Knight 'has read between the lines of Dickens’ words and eked out the psychology of why Scrooge is the way he is, which post-Freud is what we are all kind of interested in these days'.

A Christmas Carol continues on Monday night at 9PM on BBC One.
