David Silva is 'set to join' David Beckham's new MLS team Inter Miami as the Manchester City star prepares for life after nine years at the Etihad Stadium.

The Spaniard, 33, joined City from Valencia in 2010 but will seek pastures new when his contract expires next summer, having won a glut of silverware with the reigning Premier League champions while in England.

While a return to native Spain has been mooted, it seem a move across the Atlantic Ocean is looking increasingly likely for the World Cup winner.

According to the Independent, Silva has been identified as the man to be the face of the new MLS side when they take to the league next season.

Beckham is a part owner of the club and is said to be interested in bringing a Spanish-speaking big name to the club in order to capture new fans from the Hispanic community.

The Englishman shot the MLS into global attention when he joined LA Galaxy from Real Madrid in 2007, setting the trend for football superstars to make the leap to the United States in the twilight of their careers.

Inter Miami chiefs are said to be content with the idea of Silva missing the first three months of the MLS season, which is set to kick off in March, given the high-profile name and attention the Spaniard would bring to the club.

Beckham and fellow Inter Miami chiefs were seen in Barcelona earlier this month, sparking widespread speculation that the club were looking to recruit a megastar from the Nou Camp, given their financial backing.

But for now all efforts are being made to land Silva, who is said to be open to the idea of joining the new side.
