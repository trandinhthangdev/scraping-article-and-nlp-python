A teenage boy has tragically died while scaling a shopping centre roof in Perth three days before Christmas.

Emergency services were called to South Lake Shopping Centre at around 5.30am on Sunday in Perth's south following reports a teen, 16, was stuck on a roof and unable to get down after suffering a 'significant' laceration to his thigh.

A Western Australia Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia two friends climbed onto the roof to try to help the teen before raising the alarm.

It's not known why the teen was on the roof.

Department of Fire and Emergency Services personnel brought the teen down from the roof using a cherry picker.

He was rushed to Fiona Stanley Hospital but died a short time later.

Local residents told The West Australian they woke to find emergency services surrounding the vicinity as they tried to treat the teenager and attend to his friends.

Western Australia Police will prepare a report for the coroner.

The shopping centre remained closed as forensic crews spent the morning examining the scene.

Broken glass and smeared blood could be seen on the floor.

Blood was also spotted on a broken window pane.
