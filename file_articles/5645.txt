Former Arsenal striker is not convinced managerial rookie Mikel Arteta can arrest the Gunners' poor start to the season.

Manchester City coach and former Arsenal captain Arteta is set to be announced as the club's new permanent manager in the coming days.

But Kanu, who played for the club under Arsene Wenger between 1999-2004, believes Arsenal's poor performances can be improved with 'experienced management'.

'I know every fan is disappointed with the games the club have been playing of late,' Kanu told the News Agency of Nigeria.

'This is not the same Arsenal people used to know. But, all the same, we can still turn it around.

'It is clear that Arsenal are not where they are supposed to be, they have to change a lot of things and ensure that they return to the basics.

'We need a strong hand to bring back the glorious days of Arsenal.'
