MEXICO CITY, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The USMCA North American trade deal will bring jobs, technology and investment to Mexico, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Friday, a day after the agreement passed a major hurdle and was approved in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Ebrard said backing for the deal by the U.S. House had ended a long period of uncertainty for investment. USMCA must now be approved by the U.S. Senate and Canadian parliament. Is unlikely to face strong opposition in either.
