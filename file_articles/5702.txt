Eddie Hearn has guaranteed a future super-fight between Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury.

Fresh off reclaiming his unified belts with a rematch win over Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia this month, Joshua reckons Fury will get the better of Deontay Wilder in their own rematch.

Joshua has even offered to help the Gypsy King in his preparations with some sparring sessions.

And Hearn confirmed that the pair will face-off in the ring against eachother in future, no matter what happens against Wilder next year.

'[Sparring Fury is] going to be interesting with AJ's schedule. How are you going to do that?', he told iFL TV.

'I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up flying out there and doing some rounds.

'They'll definitely fight, win or lose. If Fury loses against Wilder, I promise you AJ and Fury will fight at some stage in the future.

'I can't say the same about Wilder.'

Fury's promoter, Frank Warren, has poured scorn over the 'stupid' and 'ridiculous' idea of Joshua sparring Fury.

'It's just stupid, isn't it? That's not happening. The better idea is for Anthony Joshua to say let's fight and let the fans see it', he told iFL TV.

'Why do you want to go and do it in a gym? Could you imagine them two sparring in the gym? Why would you do that? Save it for the fight.

'I don't see the sense of it behind closed doors. Do it in a ring, get paid for it. It would be the biggest fight ever. It's nonsense, stupid, ridiculous. It's the easiest fight in the world to make.'
