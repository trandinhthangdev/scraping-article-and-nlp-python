Holly matched the skirt's white waistband with adorable dangling floral earrings, and used the pop of gold to accent her brown heels.

She kept her makeup natural, opting for just foundation and concealer, and let her healthy brunette locks flow over her shoulders.

Dave wore a white-patterned shirt with a matching blue linen suit.

Holly recently made an appearance on Dave's Channel 10 show Hughesy We Have a Problem, along with the couple's three children, Sadie, eight, and Tess, six, and son Rafferty, 10.

On that particular episode, Dave recalled the moment his son Rafferty questioned how he started dating his stunning mother.

Dave said to his son: 'You asked me, "Did you meet Mum after you got famous?"'

Rafferty laughed as he said he remembered asking the question when he was six after coming home 'confused' from school.

Speaking to the studio audience and celebrity guests, Dave said: 'And I actually asked him at the time, "Why do you ask?"'

'He said, "No reason", and when I said "yes", he said "That makes sense".'
