A pensioner has won more than $1 million just before Christmas after a decade of buying tickets.

The senior citizen from Carlingford, Sydney, was quietly eating his breakfast when he was told he won $1,075,621.64 in Saturday Lotto.

'I'm spinning. I'll have to sit down in a bit,' said the man, who wished to remain anonymous.

'I've had a ticket in Saturday Lotto each week for the past decade. I got about $3,000 about a decade ago, and then little ones of $5 and $10. But this is very good.'

NSW Lotteries transformed the life of a senior citizen and his wife who won Division One in Saturday's Lotto draw

He was one of four Division One winners on Saturday December 21. Each winner took home more than a million dollars.

The man bought his ticket at the Nextra newsagency in the Carlingford Court shopping centre, in Sydney's northwestern suburb of Carlingford.

The man said he and his wife's retirement plans would be transformed.

'When the dust settles, we'll have a think about it all. It's just incredible. You've ruined whatever else I was going to do today,' he said in a media release from The Lott.

The Carlingford Court Nextra also sold a winning ticket in the 'Set for Life' lottery which gave its customer $20,000 a month for 20 years, The Lott said on Monday.
