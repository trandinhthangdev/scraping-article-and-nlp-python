MADRID, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The leader of Catalonia's regional government has been found guilty of disobedience and sentenced to a 18-month ban on holding public office, the region's highest court said on Thursday.

The sentence, which stems from Quim Torra's refusal to follow orders from Spain's electoral committee, is open to appeal, meaning the ban on holding office, if upheld, could take months to come into force.

The court also imposed a fine on Torra of around 30,000 euros ($33,066).
