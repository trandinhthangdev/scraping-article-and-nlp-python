The two areas are little more than five miles away from each other.

The Met said officers were called to nearby Courtland Avenue at 8.11pm on following a report of a fight in progress but found no trace of a victim or suspects.

They were later called to the Barnet Bypass by London Ambulance Service and medics attempted treatment, but he was pronounced dead a short time later.

The incident comes after seven men were stabbed to death in as many days in London.
