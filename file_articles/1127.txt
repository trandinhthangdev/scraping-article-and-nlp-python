A top law firm has suspended two employees after 12 women claim they were groped and sexually harassed at their office Christmas party.

Around 60 employees of Plexus Law attended the lavish party at the Malmaison Hotel in Manchester last week.

But female employees claim they were groped by two of their colleagues and were the subject of vulgar remarks.

One woman said her breasts were groped while one older married man reportedly told a woman half his age: 'The things I could do to you.'

A source told The Sun: 'There was unwanted sexual touching of a woman's breasts, unwanted sexual touching of a number of women's buttocks, kissing of their necks and other body parts.'

It was even alleged that one man said to a woman: 'I want to f*** you.'

While another asked a woman: 'How do you like to be f*****?'

Other female staff were asked where they were staying the night and if they wanted company, a source told legal news site Roll On Friday.

A spokesperson said: 'We can confirm that we have received a complaint relating to the behaviour of two individuals, which we are actively investigating.

'We take any allegations of this nature extremely seriously and we are taking all appropriate action.'

In previous years, staff at the firm have had to pay to attend the office Christmas party.
