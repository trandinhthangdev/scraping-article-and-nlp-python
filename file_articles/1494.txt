Imports Scotty Hopson and Sek Henry delivered down the stretch to help New Zealand break their NBL away duck with a 91-89 win over Illawarra on Sunday.

The win keeps the eighth-placed Breakers (6-10) with a sniff of finals action, but almost certainly ends the hopes of the bottom-of-the-table Hawks (4-11).

The Kiwi side have a vital away double next week against Brisbane and Adelaide, who are running seventh and fifth respectively.

The Breakers, who had lost their six previous away games this season, led by as many as 15 in the first quarter of Sunday's game..

Illawarra rallied and twice led by one in the last quarter, but Hopson hit a tie-breaking jumper with four seconds left, to give the visitors successive wins for the first time this season.

Hopson finished with 21 points at 72 per cent from the floor, eight rebounds and five assists, despite spending a fair chunk of time on the bench after collecting three first-half fouls.

Henry also scored 21, including eight straight points to turn a one-point final quarter deficit into a seven-point lead.

The Hawks' revival was sparked by bench guard Emmett Naar who scored 17, hitting seven of nine field goal attempts.

Veterans AJ Ogilvy and Todd Blanchfield contributed 18 and 19 points respectively..

The Breakers hit 14 three-pointers, five of them to Henry.and covered the loss of Corey Webster, who was released mid-week to take up a lucrative deal in China.

While the Hawks bench accounted for almost half of their score, they again got very little return from their two new imports, who combined for just eight points.

Darington Hobson went scoreless in almost 13 minutes and Billy Preston got eight points on two of seven field goal tries, while third import Josh Boone was suited up but did not play.

American stars LaMelo Ball (Hawks) and RJ Hampton (Breakers) both remain injured and did not play.
