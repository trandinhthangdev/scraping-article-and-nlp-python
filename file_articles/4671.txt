SYDNEY, Dec 20 (Reuters) - U.S. soybeans edged higher on Friday, with the oilseed poised to record a weekly gain of 2% as an initial trade deal between Washington and Beijing boosted prospects of increased demand from China.

FUNDAMENTALS

* The most active soybeans futures were up 0.2% at $9.26 a bushel, after closing down 0.4% on Thursday. They have gained 2% so far this week, headed for their third straight week of gains.

* The most active corn futures were up 1.5% for the week, set for their second straight weekly gain.

* The most active wheat futures were up 2.5% for the week, on track for their second straight weekly gain.

* Favourable crop weather could boost production in Argentina and Brazil, increasing global supplies and competition for export sales to buyers like China. Rains will ease dry conditions in southern Argentina and also bring relief to drier areas of Brazil, Commodity Weather Group said.

* Argentine soy planting advanced 8.9 percentage points over the last week, reaching 70.2% of expected sowing area thanks to rains that relieved excessively dry conditions, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said in a report on Thursday.

* U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday the United States and China would sign the phase one trade deal at the beginning of January.

MARKET NEWS
