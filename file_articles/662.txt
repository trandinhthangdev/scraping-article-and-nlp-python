Electricity bills have surged by $254 during the past decade even though Australians have used less power, a report found.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission blamed green schemes for everyone paying more for coal-fired power.

Its report on the national electricity market found annual bills had soared by 20 per cent or $254 between 2007/08 and 2018/19.

This occurred even though the average amount of electricity used from the grid had fallen by 17 per cent.

The ACCC said people who hadn't installed solar panels on their roofs were subsidising households that had.

'Environmental schemes add to the costs that are shared across all users of electricity from the grid,' it said.

In 2007/08, less than 0.2 per cent of homes had solar panels by this has since surged to 16 per cent.

Nonetheless, average annual power bills fell by $65 or three per cent to $1,509 during the last financial year - a point Prime Minister Scott Morrison claimed credit for.

'Power prices, as the ACCC showed yesterday, are coming down by $65 a year as a direct result of our policies,' he told the Sunrise program on Monday morning.
