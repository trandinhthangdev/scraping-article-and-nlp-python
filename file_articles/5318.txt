BRASILIA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Brazil added 99,232 payroll jobs in November, the best expansion in employment for the month since 2010, the Economy Ministry said on Thursday, as a gradual economic recovery brings improvement in the labor market.

The result was well above expectations, and more than double the forecast 47,500 new jobs in a Reuters poll of economists.

So far this year, 948,344 jobs have been created, according to the ministry's General Register of Employed and Unemployed Individuals, the best performance since 2013 for the 11-month period.

"We expect even stronger job creation in 2020 with the reactivation of the economy and continuation of the reform agenda," the ministry's secretary of social security and labor, Rogerio Marinho, said in a tweet.

Brazil´s jobless rate fell to 11.6% in the three months through October, with 12.4 million Brazilians out of work. (Reporting by Gabriel Ponte; Editing by Dan Grebler)
