John Jarratt has reportedly settled his defamation case against Sydney's The Daily Telegraph.

The Wolf Creek actor had sued the paper in the Federal Court over an article it ran following the actor's acquittal on a rape charge.

The 66-year-old actor was found not guilty by a District Court jury in July after a week-long trial.

The paper published an apology on its website on Sunday as part of the settlement, the details of which remain confidential.

In court documents, the actor's lawyers said the story that seemed to imply he was "a rapist" and had "got away with rape".

"This is incorrect. Mr Jarratt was fully acquitted of the charge after a unanimous 'not guilty' verdict by a 12 person jury in July," the newspaper's printed apology said.

"We apologise to Mr Jarratt for the hurt and embarrassment caused by the publication of the article."
