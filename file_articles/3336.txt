MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) - Uruguayan giant Peñarol gave former Manchester United striker Diego Forlán his first coaching job on Friday.

Forlan will replace head coach Diego López, whose contract ends at the end of this month.

The Montevideo-based club announced the move on Twitter.

The 40-year-old Forlán said in a news conference his brother Pablo will be one of his assistants.

"To have my first experience in a club of traditions and of a high level like Peñarol is more than I dreamed of," Forlán said.

"When you play you notice if you like soccer itself. It isn't only about playing. I enjoy it, I like it, I analyze it, I see it."

Forlán played for Peñarol in 2015-2016, near the end of a successful career that also included spells at Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Villarreal, and Argentina's Independiente.

FIFA chose him as the best player of the 2010 World Cup, where Uruguay finished third.

Peñarol lost the Uruguayan title to archrival Nacional this month.
