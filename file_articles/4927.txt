In the early 1990s she also appeared in rival soap Home and Away, playing a young school girl, Sophie Simpson.

She told RadioTimes.com that the 'work pace for weekly dramas' is very different to film and theatre.

'You learn a lot and work quickly, it's very intense,' she admitted.

She added: 'We get some very experienced actors on our show and some struggle with the sheer turnaround [because] they're used to workshopping a scene with a director for two hours on set which doesn't happen on soaps.'

Rebekah went on to say that working on a weekly soap is not suitable for everyone but she loves it.

'I much prefer the faster pace. You feed off the adrenaline. It can be stressful but personally I love it.'
