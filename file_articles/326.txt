Police fear a missing Victorian man may have been taken by a crocodile after bogging his ute in Far North Queensland's Daintree rainforest.

Milan Lemic, 25, was last seen with his bogged ute at Bairds Crossing near the Upper Daintree Village at about 4.30pm on Sunday, police say.

A passerby found Lemic and said he was going to bring back equipment to help tow his ute, but when he returned less than 30 minutes later, the 25-year-old was gone.

Mr Lemic was reported missing by his family on Saturday.

Smithfield Police Senior Sergeant Ed Lukin said police hold grave concerns for Mr Lemic's safety.

'There's no indication he's injured or a danger to the public at this stage, though there are concerns his behaviour is out of character,' he said.

'He has gone missing before, but never out of the state of Victoria- he has no ties to the area and we don't believe he's holidaying here.

'Obviously we can't discount the fact that some animal interaction may have led to his disappearance, and I've liaised with EHP and they're going to have staff on the river tonight to assess the likelihood of that outcome.'

A large-scale police search has been launched, involving a helicopter and on-ground officers.

Police are also appealing to local farmers to check buildings on their property in case he took refuge inside.

Sen-Sgt Lukin said Mr Lemic has been described as anti-social and 'probably would shun public places'.

Mr Lemic is described as having a fair complexion, around 110kg and 191cm tall with dark hair and brown eyes.

He was last seen wearing a bright fluro singlet, black gym shirt with white writing on it, black tracksuit pants, no shoes and no hat.

Police hold concerns for his safety due to the remoteness of the location where he was last seen.
