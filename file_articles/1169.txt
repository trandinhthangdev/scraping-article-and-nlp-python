Lazio pulled off a stunning victory over Juventus to win the Italian Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.

Luis Alberto struck early on before Paulo Dybala tapped home on the stroke of half-time to level the match.

However, Senad Lulic would restore the lead and, in the final minutes, Rodrigo Bentancur was dimissed for a foul on the edge of the box and substitute Danilo Cataldi converted the resulting free-kick.
