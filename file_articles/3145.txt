Sportsmail's racing expert Robin Goodfellow dishes out his tips for Saturday's meetings at Ascot, Lingfield, Haydock and Newcastle.

Those with long memories may recall Marble Arch landing the Betfair Exchange Trophy in 2001 for trainer Hughie Morrison and NOT SO SLEEPY (Ascot, nap, 3.35) may follow in those hoof prints on Saturday afternoon.

It is difficult to comprehend that 18 seasons have passed since a typically patient Norman Williamson nudged Marble Arch to a cosy defeat of Fait Le Jojo and Tikram, landing a sizeable gamble in the process.

It is highly unlikely Not So Sleepy will receive a similar ride, given he remains a rather headstrong individual, better suited by front-running and dominating his field.

Those tactics were carried out to perfection at Saturday's venue a month ago when, after being afforded a handy lead at flag fall, the once 100-rated Flat campaigner galloped on powerfully to score readily in the hands of the talented Jonathan Burke.

There is clearly a concern that Not So Sleepy won't enjoy such a charmed existence at the head of affairs now he steps up in grade, but his jumping stood up well to the pressure last time and a 5lb rise in the handicap simply ensures he creeps into this race at the foot of the weights.

It is also a bonus that Morrison's seven-year-old operated well on heavy ground on the Flat so Saturday's conditions should not represent any undue concern.

Given Evan Williams has enjoyed a terrific first half of the season, it would be no surprise to see Quoi De Neuf take a hand after an encouraging show in the Greatwood Hurdle at Cheltenham.

The novices Turnpike Trip and Sir Valentine are two others worth considering, with the latter narrowly preferred courtesy of his effectiveness on soft ground.

Earlier on the card, it is difficult to envisage defeat for Stayers' Hurdle hero Paisley Park (Ascot, 2.25), who should take full advantage of a sub-standard field in the Long Walk Hurdle.
