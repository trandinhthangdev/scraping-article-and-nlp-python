Former Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta 'is in talks to join Argentine club Estudiantes de la Plata'.

The 35-year-old, who has been playing for Japanese club Vissel Kobe since ending 22 years of service with Barcelona in 2018, is reportedly in the Argentine club's plans.

Estudiantes are managed by former Barcelona defender Gabriel Milito, who has already signed Iniesta's former Nou Camp team-mate Javier Mascherano.
