The reigning Serie A champions take on the Coppa Italia winners in Riyadh on the weekend at the King Saud University Stadium, with the first trophy of the season up for grabs.

And to celebrate the showpiece event in Saudi capital, Juventus will don a one-off kit with all their players' names written in Arabic.

'Through this choice, we want to pay tribute to a traditional art form,' chief revenue officer Giorgio Ricci told the club's official website.

'With this, Juventus proves to be, once again, close to their fans from all over the world, whilst surprising with a single jersey, which also confirms the vocation to explore new territories.

'The collaboration with the great artist, Shaker Kashgari, makes an important appointment like the Italian Super Cup even more special.'
