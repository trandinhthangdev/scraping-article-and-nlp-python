First passion: The 41-year-old actress was an aspiring ballerina and has called ballet her 'first passion'

The Guardians Of The Galaxy star told Vanity Fair in 2009 that ballet was her 'first passion' before acting.

'Ballet has always been my first passion, but I simply didn't have the feet, and I have way too much pride and ambition to just be in the corps,' she said.

Zoe's first film role was in the teen drama Center Stage about a group of young dancers who enroll at a fictitious American Ballet Academy in New York City.
