Baltimore Ravens running back Mark Ingram left Sunday's win over the Cleveland Browns with a left calf injury and did not return, then donned a walking boot after the game.

Head coach John Harbaugh told reporters there are "no structural issues" with Ingram's injury. Multiple outlets reported the running back will have an MRI on Monday.

Ingram was hurt on the first play of the fourth quarter, grabbing at his leg after quarterback Lamar Jackson kept the ball on a fake to Ingram. He limped off and was ruled questionable to return, but did not come back in the 31-15 victory.

The Ravens locked up the top overall seed in the AFC with the win, allowing them to rest their starters next week if they choose, and ensuring a first-round playoff bye the following week. That could give Ingram three weeks to recover before Baltimore's next meaningful game.

Ingram had 91 total yards and a touchdown before leaving, tying the Ravens' franchise record with his 15th score this season.

Also hurt on Sunday was tight end Mark Andrews, who came up limping later in the same drive after Ingram left. He told reporters afterward that he rolled his ankle on the play but does not believe the issue is significant.

Andrews had six catches for 93 yards and two touchdowns in the win.
