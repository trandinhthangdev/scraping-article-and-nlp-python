South Africa are meant to pick two black Africans and six players of colour

South Africa are prepared to risk more conflict over their highly sensitive quota policy by replacing the injured Temba Bavuma with Dwaine Pretorius in their team to take on England in the first Test.

The withdrawal from the squad on Friday of Bavuma with a hip injury created a delicate problem for South Africa, who are meant to pick two black Africans and six players of colour in all for every international fixture.

They could keep Cricket South Africa and their government happy by promoting Andile Phehlukwayo, who took two wickets for South Africa A against England in Benoni.

Dwaine Pretorius has been brought into the South Africa side for a test against England

But Sportsmail understands the new regime in charge of the team, led by former captain Graeme Smith, are prepared to create a storm by choosing Pretorius.

'We don't want to pick a player just to tick a box,' said a source close to the team.

South Africa, meanwhile, plan to crank up the pressure on England captain Joe Root, who desperately needs to win a series after losing in New Zealand and failing to regain the Ashes.

South Africa batting coach Jacques Kallis said: 'We'll certainly try to keep the pressure on him but he's a world-class player and he'll want to turn things around.'
