It was a pared back State Opening of Parliament today, with the pomp and pageantry of the usual Westminster theatre surrounding the Queen's Speech dialled down in the wake of October's glitzy affair.

But while the standard package involved 'reduced ceremonial elements', there were still plenty of glorious photographs taken of the colourful event which is steeped in tradition and customs dating back centuries.

Some key ceremonial elements were preserved with the Queen's Guard turning out as she left Buckingham Palace, and troopers from the Household Cavalry Division lined steps in the Palace of Westminster.

The Queen was announced with a fanfare flourish, and the royal procession saw the Crown, borne on a cushion, along with the traditional trappings of the Cap of Maintenance and Sword of State carried into the chamber.

But the monarch travelled to Parliament by car instead of a horse-drawn carriage, and also wore a dress and hat rather than the usual royal robes or crown, while Prince Charles swapped his military uniform for a morning suit.

The usual sea of glittering tiaras and formal dress sported by invited guests and dignitaries on the red benches of the House of Lords were replaced by more modest outfits, bar one who appeared not to have got the memo.

As for the main event, Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled the 'most radical Queen's Speech in a generation' with measures to toughen up criminal justice, invest in the NHS and deliver on the 'people's priorities'.

His legislative plans include Bills which will ensure the most serious violent offenders serve longer prison terms, a proposal he controversially first announced in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack last month.
