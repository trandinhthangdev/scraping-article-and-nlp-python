The big day is nearly upon us and there’s still time to nab treats without blowing the budget. I’m a big fan of south-west France for reliable co-operative wine producers such as Plaimont Producteurs – try its zesty white ‘La Petite Plume’ 2018 from Sainsbury’s for £8, with just 9% alcohol.

You can find decent vintage Cava for under a tenner, and for a few sheets more there’s good Champagne at Aldi. For a huge fruity white, my pick from Majestic was described by Rick Stein as ‘Soave on steroids’ when I poured him a glass. Thanks to air-drying the grapes you get maximum tastiness.

But to stretch your pennies further, buy sherry. My wine of the week is aged for up to 12 years in a solera system of American oak. Serve it chilled with Christmas pud and roar with glee because you’ve just won booze bingo.
