Kawhi Leonard was booed loudly every time he touched the ball but still poured in 26 points, leading six Los Angeles Clippers in double-figure scoring as the visitors routed the San Antonio Spurs 134-109 on Saturday.

An 7-0 run by the Clippers over the first 78 seconds of the third quarter expanded an 11-point halftime lead into a 78-61 advantage.

Los Angeles eventually outscored the Spurs 38-22 in the quarter, getting 28 points through 36 minutes off 14 San Antonio turnovers. The Clippers led 110-83 at that point, making the fourth period all but academic.

Leonard was traded from the Spurs to Toronto before last season, then signed with the Clippers in this past offseason. He was making his third appearance back in San Antonio as part of an opposing team and took advantage of his opportunities, especially in the first half, when Los Angeles set the tone for the game.

Leonard added nine assists and seven rebounds. Montrezl Harrell had 21 points for Los Angeles, with Lou Williams scoring 20, Maurice Harkless and Ivica Zubac hitting for 15 each, and Paul George pumping in 11 points for the Clippers.

DeMar DeRozan led San Antonio with 24 points, while Marco Belinelli added 17, LaMarcus Aldridge scored 12, and Dejounte Murray and Derrick White contributed 10 apiece.

The Clippers led 72-61 at the half behind 18 points from Leonard on 7-of-9 shooting, 16 off the bench from Williams and 10 from Harrell. DeRozan led all scorers in the first half with 20 points, 13 of them in the first quarter, with Aldridge pitching in 10 for San Antonio.

Both teams shot well over the first 24 minutes, with Los Angeles managing 56 percent to the Spurs' 53.5 percent from the floor.

The Clippers have now taken two of the three games between the two teams this year.
