The Dallas Mavericks squandered a 30-point lead as the Toronto Raptors rallied to a 110-107 win.

A Dwight Powell layup gave Dallas a 85-55 lead with 2:32 left to play in the third quarter, but Toronto had other ideas.

Kyle Lowry – who scored 32 points on the night – put 20 on the board in the fourth quarter, while the Mavericks only managed 21 in the same period as the Raptors notched up an unlikely victory, their fifth in a row.

The Oklahoma City Thunder also rallied from a double-digit deficit to see off the Los Angeles Clippers.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 32 points for the Thunder in their 118-112 victory after the Kawhi Leonard-less Clippers went up 18 points in the second quarter.
