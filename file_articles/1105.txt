The Force was a little less strong with Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker.

But J.J. Abrams' finale still raked in $175.5 million at the box office in a debut that ranked far, far away from all the other movies this weekend.

And that's after coming in with worse reviews than any Star Wars movie except 1999's The Phantom Menace, which famously debuted Jar Jar Binks.
