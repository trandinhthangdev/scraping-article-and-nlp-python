On the second last day of training for the year, North Queensland coach Paul Green is giving his players a head start in adapting to NRL rule changes for 2020.

The Cowboys mentor has brought in NRL referees to oversee training on Thursday and Friday to ensure players understand a slew of new rules that were introduced by the ARLC earlier this month.

Green, who is part of the NRL's competition committee that proposed some of the new rules, said he thinks the latest innovations will bring more unpredictability to the game.
