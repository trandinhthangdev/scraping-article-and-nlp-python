A serial dog rapist who had sex with a golden retriever and assaulted a frail old woman who was losing her eyesight says he deeply regrets what he has done.

Dean Anthony Sellenthin, 43, from Bangalow on the north coast of New South Wales, told the the Lismore District Court on Wednesday that he was 'disgusted' with his actions.

Sellenthin was due to be sentenced over a number of offences including repeatedly raping dogs, breaking into a woman's house and assaulting her, sexual assault, filming children inside their home and stealing underwear.

He was arrested in November, 2017 and had been in custody since.

Sellenthin told the court he was 'deeply sorry' over the attack of the elderly woman who has since died.

'I had no right to invade her home, to assault her,' he said, The Northern Star reported.

'I had no right to make her feel unsafe.'

Sellenthin's offences took place between 2009 to 2017.

Court documents stated Sellenthin committed acts of bestiality against a number of dogs, including a female golden retriever and a black short-haired male dog.

The documents ddid not explain how police knew Sellenthin engaged in acts of bestiality.

The 43-year-old said drug use had contributed to his offending but said he wanted it 'to stop'.

'I'm disgusted just thinking about how my life got to that point,' he said.

The 43-year-old had been imprisoned before where he completed a sex offenders' program.

The Crown Prosecutor said Sellenthin was 'impulsive' and that nobody was 'safe' even when inside their homes.

On another charge of producing child abuse material, Sellenthin's barrister, Jason Watts said he never had any contact with the children.

Sellenthin will appear in court again for sentencing on Thursday.
