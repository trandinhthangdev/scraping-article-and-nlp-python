The mother-of-three said that her children's simultaneous achievement was the 'best birthday present ever'.

The Project host uploaded two comparison photos on Instagram that showed just how much Billi and Louis had changed since they were toddlers.

She captioned the post: 'Some birthday presents simply don't come any better,' she said.

'Twenty years after that first photo was taken, these two no-longer-little munchkins have knocked their final uni exams completely out of the park on the same day.'

'Thanks for the best birthday present ever Billi and Louis. My heart is absolutely bursting,' she said.

Lisa and author Peter have been married since 1992, and share their three adult children.
