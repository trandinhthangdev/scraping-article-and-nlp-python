Bayern Munich have announced caretaker boss Hansi Flick will remain in charge until the end of the season.

The interim manager replaced Niko Kovac last month after the German champions were thrashed 5-1 by Eintracht Frankfurt.

Following Bayern's 2-0 win at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday, chairman and CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic and head coach Hansi Flick held a meeting as scheduled.

The participants analysed the sporting situation at Bayern and subsequently agreed that Hansi Flick will remain head coach of the German record champions at least until the end of the current season.

Ruminegge said on the club website: 'We at FC Bayern are very satisfied with Hansi Flick's work.

'Under him as head coach, the on-field development has been outstanding, both in terms of the quality of our play and the results achieved.

'We set a new record in the 28-year history of the Champions League with six wins in six matches in the group stage, and in the Bundesliga we have returned to touching distance of the top of the table.

'I am convinced that FC Bayern will continue next year where we left off in the last few games, namely playing attractive and successful football.

'On behalf of FC Bayern as a whole, I wish Hansi Flick every success.'

Munich have set their sights on Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel to takeover next season according to Bild.

The German publication claim that the Bundesliga giants want Tuchel to team up with Flick, who has impressed since being made interim boss last month.
