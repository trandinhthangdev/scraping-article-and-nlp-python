Two NSW volunteer firefighters have been killed in the line of duty southwest of Sydney after their fire truck rolled in the town of Buxton.

Emergency services were called to Wilson Dr just before 11.30pm on Thursday after the NSW Rural Fire Service truck was believed to have hit a tree before rolling off the road.

Police said the driver and a front passenger - both volunteer rural firefighters - died at the scene.

Three other firefighters were treated by paramedics at the scene for injuries.

The NSW RFS said the fatal incident occurred during firefighting operations and the truck had been travelling in convoy.

"The Service's thoughts are with all the firefighters' family, friends and fellow brigade members," the RFS said in a statement early on Friday.

"This is an absolutely devastating event in what has already been an incredibly difficult day and fire season."

A bushfire ripped through Buxton, Balmoral, Bargo and surrounds on Thursday, with fears up to 40 homes may have been lost.

Three firefighters were earlier treated for burns after their truck was overrun and enveloped by the Green Wattle Creek blaze, which remains at emergency warning level.
