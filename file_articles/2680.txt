Sydney FC Steve Corica has raised the prospect of next week's A-League table-topping match against Melbourne City being postponed because of the shroud of bushfire smoke in Sydney.

Corica says if the air quality remains poor, officials will need to consider calling off the game on Sunday at Jubilee Stadium.

In the wake of his team's 2-2 draw with the Phoenix in Wellington, Corica said he was bracing for a patchy build-up to the clash of the teams ranked one and two.

This week's final training run was shortened considerably because of player welfare concerns when breathing in the bushfire pollution.

Asked if they may move their training sessions out of Sydney, Corica said that wouldn't be a consideration.

"If anything they can call it (the game) off, but hopefully it won't come to that," he said.

"If it's really bad, the conditions are not great for the players to train in. We'll have to be a little bit flexible with what we do next week if the smoke's around. Which is not ideal but we have to be a little bit flexible with that."

Corica admitted the conditions were unpredictable so decisions around trainings, and the match, would need to be left until late.

The opening round 11 match between Western Sydney Wanderers and Western United at Bankwest Stadium on Friday was largely unaffected by smoke.
