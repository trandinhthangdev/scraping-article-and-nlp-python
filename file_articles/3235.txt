WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) acting chief said on Friday the agency is in talks with General Motors Co on its January 2018 petition to deploy a limited number of self-driving vehicles on U.S. roads without steering wheels or other human controls.

Acting NHTSA Administrator James Owens told Reuters the agency hopes to make a decision soon on GM's petition as well as a request by Softbank Corp-backed driverless delivery startup Nuro to deploy a limited number of low-speed, highly automated delivery vehicles without human occupants. "I expect we're going to be able to move forward with these petitions soon -- as soon as we can," Owens said, adding action "definitely" would come next year.

"This will be a big deal because this will be the first such action that will be taken." GM confirmed it has been in talks with NHTSA about the petition.
