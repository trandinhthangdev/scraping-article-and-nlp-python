He's the beloved Sunrise weatherman with an intense love for cats... and rap music.

And Sam Mac took to Instagram on Thursday to share a series of bizarre rap covers, calling himself an 'embarrassing dad' despite having no (human) children.

In the footage, the 37-year-old rapped confidently to Five, Destiny's Child, Cardi B, Ludacris, DJ Khaled and Coolio.

'Embarrassing Dad always brings the fire to impress his 14-year-old daughter & her friends,' he captioned the post, likely referring to his cat Coco.

'Swipe across for the ImMACulate collection. Number nine in my Top 19 of 2019.'

In the first clip, Sam took on If Ya Gettin' Down by Five.

Later, Sam hit a gym and hilariously danced around a buff shirtless man as he kept up the flow with Cardi B's I Like It.

Sam switched outfits for Ludacris's verse of All I Do Is Win by DJ Khaled.
