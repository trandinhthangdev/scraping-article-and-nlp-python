NEW YORK (AP) - A record price of $8.8 million for a sports memorabilia item at auction has been achieved for the 1892 manifesto to launch the modern Olympic Games.

The 14-page document written by French aristocrat Pierre de Coubertin had been expected to reach up to $1 million in the sale in New York on Wednesday.

Sotheby´s auction house said competition between three bidders drove up the price beyond the previous record for a sports item - $5.6 million for a game jersey worn by baseball great Babe Ruth sold six months ago.

The identity of the document's buyer was not disclosed.

De Coubertin´s manifesto for relaunching the Olympics was delivered in a speech at the Sorbonne university in Paris.

Two years later he founded the International Olympic Committee, and the first modern Olympic Games was held in Athens in 1896.
