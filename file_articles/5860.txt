Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy admits sacking Mauricio Pochettino last month was the 'hardest decision' he's ever made.

Pochettino lost his job after a poor opening three months of the season but despite the fact he guided Spurs to the Champions League final last year.

After replacing Pochettino with Jose Mourinho, Levy has now told the Evening Standard that it was the hardest managerial change he has had to make in his time at the club.

'Yes, because you have to understand I had built up a personal relationship with Mauricio over five-and-a-half years,' he said when asked if it was his hardest of all his managerial changes.

'It is not something I ever wanted. Personally, it was incredibly difficult, I told him that and he understood. He's been in football, he understands.

'It's not personal and I'm sure he'll come back stronger and get an opportunity to manage another great club.'

Despite the change, Levy insisted it was the right decision and said Mourinho was the 'number one candidate for the job'.

'He [Mauricio] did an amazing job and I'm sure that Jose will do equally an amazing job in a different way.'
