Manchester City have complained to the Premier League over playing two games in less than 48 hours during hectic Christmas schedule.

The champions face a 7.45pm kick-off at Wolves on Friday before taking on Sheffield United at the Etihad on Sunday with a 6.00pm start.

After beating second-place Leicester on Saturday, Pep Guardiola joked that he had sent a thank-you note to the Premier League and that he his players 'were go the fridge' between games.

'I wrote a letter to the Premier League to say thank you and we are going to the fridge after Wolves to receive Sheffield,' the City manager said.

'[Sunday 22nd] is a day off. We are training 23rd, 24th. 24th night off, 25th off. 26th training, 27th Nuno's team.'

City have contacted the Premier League to register their unhappiness with this year's fixture congestion, according to the Independent.

Midfielder Kevin De Bruyne warned it was 'impossible to play' the games with such little recovery time.

He added: 'The first game is okay, the other one – I don't know what to do. We'll see how everybody feels after 48 hours. Normally it's impossible to play, but it's the schedule and we have to find a way to manage but we'll see...'

'Hopefully everybody feels alright for these two games, but obviously we're going to have to change a few players.'
