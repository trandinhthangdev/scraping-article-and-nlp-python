Netflix has just released a trailer for its upcoming documentary series about the late Aaron Hernandez and his path from NFL star to murderer.

The series, titled Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez, will debut on Netflix on January 15.

The embattled NFL star's murder trial, conviction and prison suicide is set to be a main feature in the three part series.

The first trailer teasing the series features audio of a prison phone call between Hernandez and a woman.

'My whole body's shaking right now,' he says in the recorded call.

'What happened?' the woman asks, to which Hernandez responds: 'You know my temper.'

The series is set to feature exclusive courtroom footage from his trial and Hernandez’s phone calls from prison.

It will also have interviews with people who knew Hernandez.

The series has been made by the same studio who created Making a Murderer and Evil Genius.

Hernandez, who was drafted into the NFL at the age of 20, had just inked a five-year, $40 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested in 2013 for the murder of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd.

Hernandez was convicted in 2015 of killing Lloyd.

Two years later, the 27-year-old killed himself in his prison cell just days after being acquitted of most charges in a separate double-murder case.

A judge threw out Hernandez’s conviction that year, citing the legal principle that holds that a defendant convicted at trial who dies before an appeal is heard should no longer be considered guilty in the eyes of the law.

The prosecution then appealed and Massachusetts’ highest court reinstated his murder conviction earlier this year.
