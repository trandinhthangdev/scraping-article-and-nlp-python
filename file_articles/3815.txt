A decommissioning ceremony has also been held for HMS Clyde following its return to Portsmouth prior to being sold on to the Brazilian navy.

Commander Simon Pressdee, commanding officer of the Fishery Protection Squadron, said: “It has been a real privilege to welcome HMS Clyde home today after what has been the longest Royal Navy deployment in modern times, achieving over 12 years forward-deployed to the South Atlantic.

“During the period, over 800 members of the squadron have served in HMS Clyde, experiencing the southern oceans for over six months at a time, providing many of them with unique and special memories from an outstanding part of the planet.

“Her decommissioning this afternoon will remember all those who have served in her before we hand over this workhorse of the fleet back to BAE Systems who have carefully supported her throughout her deployment.”

A Navy spokesman said: “Some of the current crew have been with the ship for about nine months but most for about six months, the standard tour length before handing over to the relief crew.

“Having seen about 25 crew handovers over a dozen years, HMS Clyde will now be stripped of personal belongings and prepared for her handover to BAE Systems for the next phase of her life.”

Clyde’s role patrolling the Falklands will be taken over by HMS Forth, which is currently en route through the Atlantic Ocean.
