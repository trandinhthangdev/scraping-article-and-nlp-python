The 38-year-old tennis star posted photos on Instagram of her ‘Seraya Utility Pant in Olive’

Having dominated women’s tennis for nearly two decades, Serena Williams is proving just as successful as a fashion designer.

Miss Williams – who has won 23 major singles titles – yesterday showed off a pair of figure-hugging trousers from her clothing range, Serena, which she launched in the summer.

The 38-year-old tennis star posted photos on Instagram of her ‘Seraya Utility Pant in Olive’.

She teamed the look with a white shirt and snakeskin print heels.

According to the website, the trousers, which retail at £60.75, were ‘designed for the purposeful woman on-the-go’.

It adds that they feature ‘versatile utility pockets and stretch crepe designed for comfort’.

Miss Williams – who has a two-year-old daughter with husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, 36 – said the inspiration behind her designs were ‘strong women everywhere’.
