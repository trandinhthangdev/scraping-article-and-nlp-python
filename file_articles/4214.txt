This is the terrifying moment five cops risk their lives to pull a man out of a burning car after he got his leg trapped.

Dramatic footage, shot on a body camera, shows police officers using a metal pole to free driver Jonathan Morales-Fuentes' leg and foot as flames leap onto the vehicle's roof.

Mr Morales-Fuentes had crashed into a tree in Harris County, Texas, while driving home from a night shift. He suffered a fractured ankle, broken leg, nose, eye socket and a torn shoulder in the collision.

Footage shows officers racing towards the car, slammed hard against a tree, as smoke billows from its body and flames leap from its roof.

At least two officers then grab the man while a third uses a metal pole in a desperate attempt to free him from the scorching wreckage.

Suddenly the man's leg comes free, and he is dragged away from the flaming vehicle to the roadside.

Rescuer Sergeant Lance Anderson told KHOU 11 that during the desperate seconds before they freed him his foot had refused to move.

Driver Mr Morales-Fuentes was rushed to hospital, and said he got saved 'just at the right time'.

'I barely made it out alive, I'm just thankful. They saved my life,' he said.

The video was published on Harris County Constable Precinct 5's social media page.
