Timmy Allen scored 25 points and grabbed nine rebounds to lead Utah to a 69-66 win over No. 6 Kentucky on Wednesday night in the Neon Hoops Showcase at Las Vegas.

Utah's previous win against an AP Top 25 team was on Feb. 27, 2016, when it beat No. 9 Arizona 70-64 in Salt Lake City. The Utes (9-2) won their fifth consecutive game while snapping Kentucky's six-game winning streak.

The Wildcats (8-2) converted on three consecutive possessions in only 37 seconds, capitalizing on two Utah turnovers, to tie the score at 66 with 1:43 remaining in regulation, but missed a pair of 3-point tries in the final seconds after the Utes regained the lead.

Utes guard Rylan Jones, who missed last weekend's game against Weber State with rib and ankle injuries, started and contributed 12 points and six assists. Tyrese Maxey scored 18 points and Ashton Hagans added 16 for Kentucky.

No. 2 Gonzaga 94, North Carolina 81

Corey Kispert scored a game-high 26 points, two shy of his career high, as the Bulldogs defeated the Tar Heels in Spokane, Wash.

Filip Petrusev added 20 points for Gonzaga (12-1). The Bulldogs won their 29th straight game at the McCarthey Athletic Center, the longest home streak in NCAA Division I.

Garrison Brooks scored 16 points for the North Carolina (6-5), which has lost four consecutive games for the first time since 2010. Christian Keeling added 12 points, and Jeremiah Francis scored 11.

No. 3 Louisville 70, Miami (Ohio) 46

The Cardinals rattled off 17 consecutive points late in the second half to finally gain separation from the visiting RedHawks and registered a nonconference win.

Jordan Nwora paced Louisville (11-1) with a game-high 20 points and eight rebounds, while Ryan McMahon added 11 points. Dwayne Sutton (15 rebounds) and Malik Williams (11) combined for 26 boards for the Cardinals, who outrebounded the RedHawks 30-16 in the second half and 54-40 for the game.

Mekhi Lairy scored 10 points to lead Miami (5-6), which kept the Cardinals in check for about 32 minutes but couldn't make enough shots to put them in real danger. The RedHawks connected on just 27.3 percent from the field, including a lowly 6 of 33 from the 3-point arc.

No. 8 Oregon 81, Montana 48

Payton Pritchard and Will Richardson each scored 14 points as part of a balanced Ducks scoring effort as they rolled over the Grizzlies in Eugene, Ore.

Francis Okoro added 12 points and 17 rebounds for Oregon (9-2), which welcomed touted freshman N'Faly Dante into the playing rotation for his college debut. Dante finished with 11 points in 14 minutes.

Kendal Manuel led Montana (4-6) with 15 points. Sayeed Pridgett added 11 points and eight rebounds.

No. 9 Virginia 56, Stony Brook 44

Kihei Clark scored 14 points, Mamadi Diakite added 13 points, and the Cavaliers held off the Seawolves in Charlottesville, Va.

Reigning national champion Virginia (9-1), playing its first game in 10 days, showed no rust from the delay after its Atlantic Coast Conference win over North Carolina on Dec. 8. The Cavaliers jumped to a 14-2 lead, then kept Stony Brook at arm's length with a wire-to-wire lead.

Stony Brook (7-6) cut the initial deficit to seven by halftime, but shooting woes prevented the Seawolves from making it any more competitive than that. Elijah Olaniyi led the Seawolves with 11 points and grabbed seven rebounds but went just 1 of 6 from deep.

No. 10 Baylor 91, Tennessee-Martin 63

Davion Mitchell scored 19 points on 9-of-12 shooting and collected four steals to help the Bears cruise to a blowout victory over the Skyhawks in the Battleground 2K19 at the Toyota Center in Houston.

Jared Butler also scored 19 points and added six assists and three steals as Baylor (9-1) won its eighth straight game. MaCio Teague scored 12 points, and Mark Vital and Flo Thamba added 11 points apiece.

Parker Stewart scored 18 points for the Skyhawks (3-7), who have lost six of their past seven games. Miles Thomas added 17 points on 7-of-9 shooting, and Quintin Dove had 12.

No. 15 Michigan State 77, Northwestern 72

Cassius Winston scored 21 to lead the Spartans to a victory over the Wildcats in Evanston, Ill.

The victory means Michigan State (8-3, 2-0 Big Ten) sits alone in first place as the only unbeaten team in conference play as 12 teams are 1-1 through the first two games.

Xavier Tillman added 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Spartans. Boo Buie scored 26 for Northwestern (5-5, 0-2), which made a late run and pulled within four in the final two minutes.

No. 20 San Diego State 92, San Diego Christian 48

Yanni Wetzell put up 17 points to lead four double-figure scorers for the host Aztecs, who cruised past the NAIA Hawks.

San Diego State (11-0) built an 18-point lead by halftime, then blew the game open with a 23-4 run to open the second half. The 44-point final margin of victory marked the largest lead of the night.

KJ Feagin scored 12 points and dished out eight assists, setting the tone for the Aztecs' unselfish approach in the rout. Twenty-four of San Diego State's 33 made field goals came via assists, and the scoring load was distributed relatively evenly among the starting five.

Cincinnati 78, No. 21 Tennessee 66

Tre Scott scored 15 points to lead the host Bearcats over the Volunteers before Cincinnati's first home sellout of the season.

The Bearcats (7-4), who shot 56.4 percent for the game, also got 11 points each from Jaevin Cumberland, Keith Williams, Chris Vogt and Mika Adams-Woods.

Tennessee (7-3) was led by John Fulkerson, who had 14 points and four steals. Volunteers coach Rick Barnes, who has 699 career wins, lost in his second straight opportunity to become just the seventh active Division I coach to reach 700.
