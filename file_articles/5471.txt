LYONS, Kan. (AP) - The girlfriend of a Kansas man who fatally shot his father and wounded two Kansas law enforcement officers before killing himself was sentenced to 60 days in jail.

District Judge Mike Keeley told Erin Baker that she had some responsibility for the April 29 shooting in ordering the sentence Wednesday for aggravated child endangerment and obstruction of law enforcement, The Wichita Eagle reported. She previously entered a no contest plea to the charges under a deal in which prosecutors dropped an interference charge.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation says Baker put her 7-year-old in danger by continuing a relationship with David Madden, despite knowing he was a convicted felon with a gun. She was behind the wheel when Rice County Undersheriff Chad Murphy pulled her over in the town of Sterling, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) northwest of Wichita.

Madden, who was was under investigation for the disappearance of an Illinois woman, critically wounded Murphy while Baker's child was in the backseat. He then ordered Baker to drive to his house, where he got more guns and ammunition.

She said she and her son got away once they dropped Madden off at the home of his father, 65-year-old Thomas Madden. That's where police say David Madden fatally shot his father, wounded the sheriff in the leg, then killed himself.
