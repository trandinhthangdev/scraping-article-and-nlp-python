South Australians have been warned to look out for blue-ringed octopuses at the beach as a heatwave grips the state.

Adelaide is facing temperatures of more than 40°C on Thursday and Friday.

David Bacchus, Surf Life Saving South Australia and emergency operations manager, said water warming in rock pools increased the likelihood of sightings.

'There's potential this time of year and octopus are very hasty to the changing weather conditions,' Mr Bacchus told The Advertiser.

'Because of the heat they like to be near structure, so it's something to be aware of with a lot more people going to the beach.'

There have been no official sightings of the animal this summer.

But people said they have seen them on beaches such as Aldinga and Port Hughes Jetty.

Secretary Chief Instructor Richard Nurmi, from Christies Beach SLSC, said people should watch out for the blue-ringed octopus on rocks.

Meanwhile Richard Olesinski, Southport Surf Life Saving Club President, said the animals have been known to crawl into drink cans.

Blue-ringed octopus bites are highly venomous and people who have been bitten should call emergency services.

The animals typically aren't aggressive and most cases of biting are because people have picked them up.

Blue-ringed octopuses aren't the only concern for beachgoers in South Australia.

An eastern brown snake was found on the water's edge at Port Norlunga on Wednesday morning.

'It's so hot in Adelaide even the snakes are cooling off at the beach,' the Adelaide Snake Catchers Facebook page captioned the image.
