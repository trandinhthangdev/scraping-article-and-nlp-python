Andy Murray showed his light-hearted side in sharing a video of one of his quirkier exercises as he stepped up his off-season preparations.

The former World No 1 is still searching for his best form and fitness following hip resurfacing surgery last January to cure a long-term problem.

Yet, with the tennis season due to resume in January, Murray is hard at work and is clearly leaving no stone unturned in his quest to return to the top.

Jokingly captioned 'Sliding into the weekend like..' Murray appears to be mimicking the side-to-side action of an ice skater to strengthen his lateral movements on the obsidian board.

Standing on a purpose-built white board, the Scot pushes off from one side to reach the other edge of the board, before pushing back and repeating the action.

While he looks confident sliding to his right, the former British No 1 looks a little hesitant has he slides back on his left hand side.

As a result of his time away from the sport with injury, Murray currently sits at 125 in the world rankings.

He has made encouraging progress this year though, beating Stan Wawrinkwa to win the European Open in October - his first singles title since his return.
