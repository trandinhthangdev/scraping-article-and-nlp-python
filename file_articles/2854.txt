Expecting father Nick Flanagan will do his best to continue playing pressure-free golf in Sunday's Australian PGA Championship finale after equalling the course record to launch into contention.

The former US Amateur champion carded a bogey-free nine-under 63 to equal Ross McGowan's mark and go from one-over to eight-under and a shot back from Saturday's overnight leader.

Chinese leader Yuan Yechun (nine-under) is on course with Adam Scott (seven-under), while two-times defending champion Cameron Smith (five-under) was even through five holes.

Flanagan was through the front nine in 30, before narrowly missing a number of birdie putts and one eagle chance that would have seen him flirt with a magical sub-60 shot round.

He had a long birdie putt on the 18th to claim the record outright, which slid past and meant a simple par to close a memorable round.

Now based in San Antonio, Flanagan's wife is expecting their first child in mid-January and he said, after missing a number of cuts in recent tournaments, he was treating Saturday's round as a free swing.

And while he knows the intensity will likely lift in front of larger galleries on Sunday, Flanagan insists he won't overplay it.

"It got to a point today where I've been playing so bad and trying so hard that I thought I'd just go out there and not try at all, and all of a sudden, you loosen up over the ball," he said.

"It'll be different tomorrow; I'll have to get back to being intense again but stay relaxed enough that it's no big deal if things don't work out.

"I've got a baby due in five weeks, that's what I'll be thinking about but obviously I'd love to go out there and win so it's finding that balance again."
