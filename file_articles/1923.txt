The star sported a short stylish red haircut, which seemed to channel her Devil Wears Prada character Miranda Priestly.

Kidman was in character Thursday, as she filmed a scene in an oversized orange turtleneck.

They star in the film as Broadway stars looking to revive their careers by getting behind a good cause, helping two lesbian teenagers who were prevented from going to prom together.

The movie is based on the Tony-nominated Broadway musical of the same name, which ran from November 2018 to August 2019.
