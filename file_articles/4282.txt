What is anaphylactic shock? Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that effects the whole body. It is most often caused by insect bites, particularly bees and wasps, and foods including nuts, milk and fish. Symptoms include feeling faint, breathing difficulties, a fast heartbeat, an itchy rash or swelling of the tongue and throat. Victims can also become confused and anxiopus or collapse and lose consciousness. Symptoms typically start within 15 minutes and can become severe very quickly. It is caused by the body's immune system overreacting to a trigger

The funeral of Mr Diniz's 45-year-old son, Rui, was postponed and the family now intend to bury them alongside each other. It is not known how Rui, his only child, died.

An investigation into the tragedy is underway but a local official said everything was pointing to the dead man suffering an allergic reaction to the bee stings.

He was taken to a health centre immediately after the attack at around 10am before being transferred to a hospital when his condition deteriorated.

Roraima is the northernmost and least populated state of Brazil. It borders the states of Amazonas and Para and the countries of Venezuela and Guyana.
