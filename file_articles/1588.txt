Josh Nebo scored 15 points and tied a career high with eight blocked shots, and Texas A&M's defense was the difference in the second half in a 64-49 win over Oregon State in College Station, Texas, on Saturday.

The Aggies' ball-pressure defense helped create an 18-3 run in the second half and a 49-41 lead with 5:36 to play. Oregon State started the second half 4 of 21 from the floor and went scoreless for more than four minutes, allowing Texas A&M to take control.

A 3-pointer by Wendell Mitchell with 2:42 remaining stretched the Aggies' lead to 54-43 and all but sealed the upset.

Savion Flagg and Quenton Jackson added 13 points each for the Aggies (5-5) and Emanuel Miller led all players with 13 rebounds. All five of Texas A&M's wins this season have been at home.

Tres Tinkle had 21 points for the Beavers (9-2), which had a seven-game winning streak snapped. Oregon State, which came into the game averaging almost 81 points per game, is still off to its best start since the 1984-85 campaign.

The Beavers shot just 23.5 percent in the second half, including missing all 11 of their 3-point attempts.

Texas A&M's interior defense was a key in the first half as the Aggies erased an early seven-point deficit to take a 22-20 lead on a three-point play by Nebo with 4:15 to play. Oregon State answered with a 10-0 run and led 30-22 at the break.

Tinkle scored nine straight points late in the half for the Beavers and led all scorers with 15. Oregon State outshot the Aggies 47.8 percent to 31.8 percent over the first 20 minutes.

The Aggies missed their last four shots of the half and had five turnovers over the final four minutes.

A desperation 3-pointer and subsequent for a four-point play by Jay Jay Chandler with 9:42 to play gave Texas A&M a 39-38 lead. Oregon State missed eight straight shots in the four-minute stretch that allowed the Aggies to jump to the front.
