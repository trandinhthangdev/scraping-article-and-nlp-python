Sweet: David Beckham shared a 'ridiculously cute' video of his daughter Harper, eight, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas in American Sign Language on Saturday

He captioned the clip with: 'I mean come on this is ridiculously cute & Harper wanted to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas [Christmas tree and heart emojis] #ASL.'

American Sign Language (ASL) is different from British Sign Language (BSL) and is the third most common used language in the US.

It comes amid reports that Victoria Beckham is clashing with husband David's father over her plans to christen Harper, eight, and Cruz, 14.

The couple are said to have spent thousands on the glamorous event, with Harper's alleged godmother Eva Longoria pictured arriving in London on Friday.

But David's father Ted, 71, is said to be annoyed his partner's daughter Charlotte, 27, has been snubbed from the exclusive guestlist because the Beckhams 'couldn't fit one more in'.

The Sun reports Ted, who is divorced from David's mother Sandra, has been invited to the event with his new partner, 60-year-old millionaire and solicitor Hilary Meredith, but her daughter Charlotte didn't make the list.

A source told the publication while Charlotte wanted to go as a 'family unit', Victoria's 'mistrust of outsiders' led to her being blocked from attending.

The source said: 'Charlotte believes they are a family and should be invited as a unit, in the end Ted asked David if they could bring her.

'He said he’d speak to Victoria, but he came back and said sorry they couldn’t fit one more in.

'The bottom line is Victoria’s mistrust of any outsiders being brought into the fold.'

The source added all staff working at the event have had to sign non-disclosure agreements.

MailOnline has contacted Victoria's spokesperson for comment.

Sources say the event will be an A-list affair with Victoria and David picking Cruz's godfather as director Guy Ritchie, while actress Eva will be a godmother to Harper, along with Victoria's sister Louise.

The celebrations are said to be happening at the Beckhams’ Cotswolds manor house, with guests Liv Tyler, Sir Elton John and David Furnish also invited.

Elton is already godfather to Brooklyn and Romeo.

A source previously told The Sun: 'They have asked party-goers to dress in full-length and fabulous. They really enjoy family events like this and are very proud parents.

'They think Christmas is the perfect time for a christening party. Drinks will be flowing, chefs will serve amazing food and there will be spectacular fireworks.'

David's father Ted met Hilary at ex-services care home Broughton House in Manchester back in April.

Ted and his former partner Sandra married in autumn 1969 and share three children; Lynne, 47, David, 44, and Joanne, 37.

Following over three decades of marriage, the pair split in 2002, during the last months of footballer David's Manchester United career.

In an interview with The Mirror back in 2005, Ted admitted his children had been affected by his split from Sandra.

He shared at the time: 'David has spoken about how hard our splitting up was for him - it was tough for all our children.

'I know they were all pretty much grown up by the time we got divorced but it was still a heck of a shock for them.

'We'd been married for 33 years and had simply drifted apart. Just about the only thing we had in common was football.'
