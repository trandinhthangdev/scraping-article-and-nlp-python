ALMATY, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's central bank considers a policy rate 3.0-3.5 percentage points above inflation neutral, Vitaliy Tutushkin, head of the bank's monetary policy department said on Friday, a change from the previous estimate of 2.0 percentage points.

The bank held its policy rate at 9.25% this month, citing the need to preemptively curb with a "slightly restrictive" policy the expectations of higher inflation and tenge depreciation due to the widening current account gap. (Reporting by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by David Clarke)
