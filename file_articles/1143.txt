These shocking images show a severely-underweight dog which was 'close to death' after it it was abandoned by its cruel owner just before Christmas.

The female lurcher - who has been named Tiggy - was rescued by animal welfare officers after being dumped on a street in Blyth, Northumberland.

Now Northumberland County Council are appealing to find the owners of the abused pup.

The devastating photos show the neglected pooch with barely any fur and with her ribs jutting out dramatically from her body.

Fortunately, along with some much-need tender loving care, a second picture shows Tiggy wearing a comfy coat fashioned out of a warm rug after being rescued.

Tiggy, believed to be around three years old, is now being cared for in a foster home organised through Berwick Animal Rescue Kennels where she is on a special diet to help her regain some weight.

Animal welfare officers were called to reports of Tiggy in Blyth and were distressed by the state in which they found her.

A council animal welfare officer said: 'This dog was in a really horrific state. Someone, somewhere knows who she belongs to, or has seen her about.

'She was completely skin and bone and less than half the weight she should have been.

'She had no fur, has never been microchipped and seems to have just been dumped out on the streets.

'This is a shocking and inexcusable case of neglect and we are very keen to get to the bottom of how she came to be in such an emaciated condition and bring the person(s) responsible to account.'
