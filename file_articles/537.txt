Joshua Jackson and Jodie Turner-Smith stepped out in public together for the first time since getting married.

The couple were spotted enjoying a casual Sunday picking up some lunch to go and grocery shopping in Los Angeles on Sunday, with The Affair star's wedding ring in full view just two days after Us Weekly confirmed the couple were getting married.

Not only did the pair tie-the-knot, they're also expecting their first child together.

Rumors that the couple had began dating began in November 2018, when they were seen holding hands during a stroll around Los Angeles.

They also got hot and heavy at Usher's 40th birthday party the previous month.

In August, they reportedly obtained a marriage license, which is valid for 90 days.

Jackson had previously been in a long-term relationship with German-American actress Diane Kruger from 2006-2016.

He dated Dawson's Creek co-star Katie Holmes during the first two seasons of the show's run that began in 1998.

During an interview around that same time, Holmes called Jackson her 'first love.'

Jackson has also been romantically linked to Rosario Dawson.
