Hank Haney filed a lawsuit against the PGA Tour for forcing SiriusXM Radio to fire the renowned golf instructor from his radio show, Golf Channel Digital reported Wednesday.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, claimed the PGA Tour "improperly intimidated, enticed and threatened" SiriusXM to fire Haney. It also said the host was fired to "settle an old score relating to professional golfer Tiger Woods."

The lawsuit claimed the Tour had "long attempted to disrupt and interfere in Haney's business" following the release of his 2012 book, "The Big Miss," that chronicled his years working as Woods' swing coach.

The Golf Channel report said Haney's firing stemmed from a comment he made about the possible U.S. Open Women's winner during his show in May.

Asked by co-host Steve Johnson who he thought would win the U.S. Open, Haney replied, "a Korean," before adding, "I couldn't name you six players on the LPGA Tour. Maybe I could. Well ... I'd go with Lee. If I didn't have to name a first name, I'd get a bunch of them right."

Initially suspended by SiriusXM for the comment, Haney apologized. He later was fired.

Haney said the termination cost him "millions of dollars" of advertising revenue.

The PGA Tour had no comment.
