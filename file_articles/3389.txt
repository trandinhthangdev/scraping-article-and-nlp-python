WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday said it has finalized a decision to roll back a George W. Bush-era rule to phase out incandescent light bulbs, saying that requirements for energy efficient bulbs would be costly to consumers.

The administration finalized a proposal made in September to roll back the standard that was to come into effect next year. The move has been challenged by 16 states including New York and California who say it would harm state efforts to fight emissions blamed for climate change.
