The Wests Tigers have finally landed their man with Samoan prop Zane Musgrove signing a two-year deal with the club effective immediately.

The 23-year-old former South Sydney forward had agreed to join the club in 2019 before he was charged with three counts for an alleged incident at the Coogee Bay Hotel during the NRL's "summer of hell".

Musgrove pleaded not guilty, but the NRL subsequently refused to register his contract and he was effectively sidelined for 12 months.

However, the NRL has given Musgrove the green light to return given he has essentially served a 12-month ban and two of the original charges were dropped.

Two of the three charges including indecent assault and common assault were dropped, though Musgrove and Penrith lower-grade player Liam Coleman were found guilty of assault with an act of indecency.

In October the Downing Centre Local Court heard a woman told police Musgrove had kissed her aggressively and repeatedly.

He was cleared to return to training with the Tigers in November under coach Michael Maguire, who handed him his NRL debut with the Rabbitohs in 2016.

In a statement released on the club's website, Tigers chief executive Justin Pascoe commended Musgrove on his actions over the past 12 months as the NRL assessed whether he is a fit and proper person to return to the game.

"I'd like to officially welcome Zane to the club and say how pleased we are to see him as part of our squad for the coming years," Pascoe said.

"As much as we are certain he will bring a lot to this club on field each week, we're also convinced Zane will have a key role to play off the field too.

"Wests Tigers is a club with strong convictions and a strong identity, and I have no doubt that Zane's rugby league journey so far will continue to see him develop into a fine young man."

The Wests Tigers have now filled 27 spots in their NRL roster for 2020.
