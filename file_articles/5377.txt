The centre-back, whose last first-team appearance came in August 2018, was diagnosed with cancer having only recently returned to full training following a lengthy spell on the sidelines due to deep vein thrombosis.

MacDonald progressed through Reading's academy and had loan spells at Salisbury, Basingstoke, Torquay and AFC Wimbledon.

He later enjoyed permanent stints with Salisbury and Torquay before moving to Oakwell in August 2016.
