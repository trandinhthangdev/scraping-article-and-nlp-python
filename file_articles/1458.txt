David Beckham has looked to revive Joe Hart's career by offering him a transfer to new MLS outfit Inter Miami.

The Beckham-owned franchise, who face Los Angeles FC in their first-ever MLS fixture on March 1, are desperately looking for star names ahead of their eagerly-anticipated bow.

And according to The Sun, Beckham has offered his former England team-mate a deal with Inter Miami.

Former England goalkeeper Joe Hart has been offered a career lifeline by David Beckham

The ex-England goalkeeper is currently behind Nick Pope in the pecking order at Burnley, having featured just once in all competitions so far this season.

According to reports, Hart has become very frustrated with his situation in England, and has told some of his Burnley team-mates that Beckham has been in touch with him.

The 32-year-old has endured a torrid time since being axed at Manchester City by Pep Guardiola, who told him he was not good enough with his feet.

Back in 2016, Hart was sent out on loan to Serie A outfit Torino by City before joining West Ham on a temporary basis.

The shot-stopper then signed for Burnley in the summer of 2018 and featured 19 times in the Premier League last season, deputising for Nick Pope and Tom Heaton.

However, this time round he has had to make do with the bench - playing just once in the Carabao Cup defeat to Sunderland back in August.
