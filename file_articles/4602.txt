Julian Wilson has booked his spot in the Australian team for Tokyo 2020, when surfing will make its Olympic debut.

Wilson will join Owen Wright in the men's competition in Japan, despite being eliminated in the last 16 of the Pipe Masters in Hawaii on Thursday (Friday AEDT).

Brazil's Italo Ferreira won the event at Pipeline to claim the 2019 World Surf League world title, defeating countryman Gabriel Medina in a winner-takes-all final in Hawaii.

Queenslander Wilson finished 11th in the final season rankings, three places above countryman Jack Freestone, who needed to win the event to secure his Olympic berth.

Wilson was eliminated by Yago Dora in the last 16, while Freestone's defeat to American legend Kelly Slater in the quarter-finals ended both his Olympic dream and his chance to win the prestigious Triple Crown of Surfing.

Aussie Soli Bailey also went out of the competition in the round of 16 after losing to John John Florence.

Wilson will now compete in the men's surfing at Tokyo alongside Wright, with Stephanie Gilmore and Sally Fitzgibbon representing Australia in the women's competition.

Wright, the only male Aussie surfer to rank inside in the top 10 in 2019, finished ninth in the final standings, two places ahead of Wilson.

Gilmore and Fitzgibbon will represent the country's best chance of securing medals in Tokyo, with Gilmore finishing fourth in the 2019 rankings, one place above Fitzgibbon.
