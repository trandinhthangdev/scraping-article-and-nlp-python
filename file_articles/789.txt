A boardroom bust-up has broken out at Aviva after its chief executive backtracked on a plan to split the insurer into two.

A proposal drafted this year laid out plans to separate the company’s general insurance arm from its life insurance division.

But despite boardroom support for the deal, chief executive Maurice Tulloch (pictured) opted instead for a watered-down restructuring that simplified the business by eliminating nine of its 14 divisions, leaving just five.

The original deal was expected to add billions to the company’s stock market value, and its rejection is thought to have caused dismay on the board. Several bosses now fear the £16billion firm could be the target of an activist investor, The Sunday Telegraph reported.

Other insurers, including Prudential and Legal & General, have split parts of their business. Aviva declined to comment last night.
