Norwich and Southampton are eyeing a move for Chelsea youngster Marc Guehi according to The Sun.

But they face competition from Swansea, Bristol City and Nottingham Forest who all see the England under-17 World Cup winner as the missing piece of the jigsaw to seal promotion from the Championship.

The trio of second-division clubs are all offering regular football which could give them the upper hand in negotiations with the Blues.

The Blues, who spotted Guehi playing in south-east London at the age of nine, will have to decide whether the right move will be to drop down a division or battle for survival in the Premier League.

The Canaries believe the 19-year-old will fit in seamlessly with their style of play for the second half of the campaign.

Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl has admitted he desperately needs new defenders to shore up his leaky defence.

Guehi has been accelerated through the England system to Aidy Boothroyd's U21 squad and as a result Chelsea tied him down to a new long-term deal in September.

But the Blues are eager to see him develop his game elsewhere with no shortage of clubs ready to sign the teenager.
