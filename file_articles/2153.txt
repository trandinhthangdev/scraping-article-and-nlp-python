GUAYNBO, Puerto Rico (AP) - Chennedy Carter scored 27 points, Ciera Johnson added 17 and No. 11 Texas A&M held off Montana State 78-67 at the Coqui Classic on Saturday.

Kayla Wells added 13 points for the Aggies (11-1), who have won six straight and went 2-0 in the tournament.

It wasn't until Johnson's three-point play in the final minute made it a nine-point game that the Aggies had the game in hand. Carter, who has scored in double figures in 51 straight games, and Johnson both had eight rebounds.

Montana State (4-5) was led by Oliana Squires with 15 points, Fallyn Freije with 12 and Darian White with 11.

Montana State scored the first seven points of the game, five by Freije, and led until the closing minutes of the first half. A 3-pointer by Tori Martell late in the first quarter had the Bobcats up 19-9. Johnson had a layup and a three-point play, which capped a second 7-0 surge in the second quarter, to help the Aggies take a 35-33 lead at the half.

Leading 57-48 at the end of the third quarter, the Aggies got the lead to 10 early in the fourth before the Bobcats scored eight straight. Carter scored the Aggies' next six points as they inched ahead and Aaliyah Wilson's clutch 3-pointer with just over three minutes to go made it an eight-point game.
