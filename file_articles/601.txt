Cameron Smith must continue to fight for a Masters berth after narrowly missing out on a guaranteed spot as the golf year closes.

The Queenslander will enter a brief off-season break ranked No.53, three spots shy of the world top 50 at year's end who earned early entry to Augusta National in April.

Fresh from his drought-breaking Australian PGA triumph on Sunday, Adam Scott has risen to No.13 and will be joined at the Masters by countrymen Marc Leishman (28) and Jason Day (36).

Young Victorian amateur Lukas Michel will also be there after becoming the first Australian to win the US Mid-Amateur Championship in September.

Smith impressed when tied fifth at the 2018 Masters - earning him another start there this year - before also finishing 2018 ranked 27 in the world.

Now he needs to either win a US tour event or be in the world top 50 the week before the Masters to get back to Augusta National for the year's first major.

"That's going to be the goal but probably not the long-term goal," said Smith.

"I definitely want to be at the Masters, that's on everyone's mind, for sure.

"But as long as I stay on top of my game, I think I should go alright."

Fellow US tour players Matt Jones (world No.100), Aaron Baddeley (252), Cameron Percy (278) and Cameron Davis (305) will all likely need tournament wins between now and the Masters to get in.
