A local recovery coordinator has been appointed to support communities affected by the Adelaide Hills bushfire.

Premier Steven Marshall says police officer Alex Zimmerman will begin work with the local community to understand their recovery needs and identify what additional assistance is required.

"Many in our Adelaide Hills community are facing extraordinary tragedy right now but South Australia is rallying behind them," Mr Marshall said.

"Having a designated person to coordinate the recovery and help residents and local businesses get back on their feet will be a real help at this difficult time.

"Residents, schools, small businesses and primary producers will all have different recovery needs and we will work hand in hand to support them all in the best way possible."

Mr Zimmerman is familiar with the challenges of supporting a community in recovery, having served as recovery coordinator during the 2015 Pinery fire and the 2016 Virginia floods, north of Adelaide.

The communities currently affected by the Hills fire include Cudlee Creek, Lobethal, Woodside, Birdwood, Inverbrackie, Harrogate, Brukunga, Charleston, Kenton Valley, Mount Torrens and Lenswood.

More than 70 homes have been destroyed and many more damaged, along with hundreds of outbuildings and vehicles.

The blaze continues to burn in some areas and has already run through 25,000 hectares inside a 127-kilometre perimeter.

"In the past few days, the acts of bravery and support from communities right across South Australia has been incredible," Mr Marshall said.

"People from all walks of life have rallied together to fight fires across our state and support those in need."

South Australians directly affected by the Adelaide Hills fire may be eligible for both personal hardship grants of up to $700 and Australian government disaster recovery payments of up to $1000.
