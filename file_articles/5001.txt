And just before 8.30pm, a man in his 30s was found knifed to death near Barnet Bypass in an unrelated killing after police received reports of a fight.

Officers were called to Bromley Road in Walthamstow, north east London at 7.16pm on Thursday following reports of two men suffering from stab injuries
