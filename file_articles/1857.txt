SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) - San Francisco 49ers guard Mike Person will start against the Los Angeles Rams despite being listed this week as questionable with a neck injury.

Person was made active for Saturday night's NFC West showdown. San Francisco also got two key players back in the secondary this week with cornerback Richard Sherman and cornerback K'Waun Williams active after missing time with injuries.

The other players inactive for San Francisco are safety Jaquiski Tartt (ribs), defensive end Dee Ford (quadriceps, hamstring), defensive tackle Jullian Taylor (elbow), receiver Jordan Matthews, running back Jeff Wilson and tight end Daniel Helm.

The players inactive for the Rams are cornerback Troy Hill (thumb), defensive back Dont'e Deayon, safety Jake Gervase, linbacker Natrez Patrick, offensive lineman Jamil Demby, tackle Rob Havenstein and tight end Kendall Blanton.

Kicker Greg Zuerlein is active after being listed as questionable with a right quadriceps injury.
