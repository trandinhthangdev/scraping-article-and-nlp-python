Next year is expected to bring more record-breaking heat, forecasters warned yesterday – after Australia endured its hottest day ever.

The Met Office said Earth will be about 1.11C above pre-industrial levels in 2020 due to rising greenhouse gases.

The hottest years have all come since 2015 when temperatures broke the 1C threshold for the first time.

Earth will be about 1.11C above pre-industrial levels in 2020 due to rising greenhouse gases, said the Met Office (stock)

In 2016 they were 1.16C above pre-industrial levels – an all-time high. Records began in 1850.

Australia saw its most torrid day on Tuesday, with an average high of 41C (106F), beating a January 2013 record.

But the mark could be exceeded today and again tomorrow, according to Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) data.

BOM recorded a peak temperature of 47C in Oodnadatta, a South Australian town of about 200 people.

Met Office’s forecast last year for 2019 is in line with what has actually happened this year, at around 1.1C above the pre-industrial level.

Dr Doug Smith, Met Office research fellow, said: ‘The forecast for 2020 would place next year amongst the six warmest years on record, which would all have occurred since 2015.

‘All of these years have been around 1.0C warmer than the pre-industrial period.’

Dr Nick Dunstone, an expert in climate variability at the Met Office, added: ‘Although the earth has warmed by about 1C on average since pre-industrial times, this isn’t spread evenly over the surface of the globe as much of the warming is occurring in the Arctic and over land masses.’
