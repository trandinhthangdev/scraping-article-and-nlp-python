Manchester United have joined the race to sign highly-rated Barcelona talent Jean-Clair Todibo, with the Spanish giants willing to part ways with the youngster for £17million.

The French starlet, who can play in central defence or defensive midfield, joined Barca from Toulouse for around £2million earlier this year, but could be on his way out next month.

While Spanish chiefs rate the youngster highly, limited first team opportunities has lead to an overwhelming consensus that Todibo needs first team minutes.

And, according to Sport, Manchester United could be the club to provide Todibo development opportunities, with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looking for midfield reinforcements with Nemanja Matic likely to leave and Paul Pogba's future uncertain.

However, the Premier League club are said to be put off by Barca's preference for a buy back clause for the youngster, as they seek to avoid their European rivals nabbing the player for a cut price fee further down the line.

United may face competition for Todibo's signature from Premier League rivals Southampton and Everton. The Toffees could be a pull for the France Under-20 international, with the club announcing Carlo Ancelotti as their new manager on Saturday.

Bayer Leverkusen and Inter Milan are also interested in the Frenchman, although their English counterparts are more likely to stump up the money Barcelona are seeking.
