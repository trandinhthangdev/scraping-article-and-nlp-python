It was always the right decision by Jurgen Klopp to send his first-team squad to Qatar and the kids to Aston Villa for the Carabao Cup.

And I say that as someone who won two League Cups for the club, loved every moment of that and still feel it is a brilliant competition.

Liverpool’s history is based on winning trophies and world champions is not something they had achieved. And while the League Cup is not a competition that should be belittled, the truth is competing against the champions of each continent is globally more important, both to the fanbase and marketplace.

Jurgen Klopp was right to prioritise the Club World Cup over the Carabao Cup

Sending a young team to get thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa may benefit the first team

The second aspect has been less publicised but by Klopp taking his full squad away, it should refresh them and recharge their batteries for the second half of the season which they want to finish as Premier League champions.

Going away together, to warmer climes, a change in environment, is a massive benefit at this stage of the season, and just spending time together like that will solidify the team spirit.

Say Klopp had left Divock Origi, Adam Lallana and James Milner back home to play Villa, I don’t think they would have felt rested and raring to go for the new year as they will do now.

I know if I’d been a squad player at Liverpool, I would rather have gone to Qatar with the rest of the guys and played a few minutes, as it’s a break from the routine.
