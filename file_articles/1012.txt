Police are hunting a stolen car following a series of incidents where drivers were threatened with a gun, assaulted and robbed across Adelaide.

Beginning from 5.30am on Sunday, police received six separate reports in the suburbs of Salisbury North, Blakeview, Walkerville, Paralowie, Ingle Farm and Valley View.

The final report came at 9.20pm, when a man was approached in Pauls Drive at Valley View and threatened before he was assaulted with what he described as a shotgun.

The man then stole the victim's vehicle, a blue 2011 Ford Falcon utility.

A stolen silver Hyundai linked to one of the earlier reports was located nearby and police are working to confirm if the incidents are linked.

Police are asking anyone who spots the stolen blue 2011 Ford utility, SA registration S325APC, with a black tarp over the tray and silver sports bar to contact triple zero. The public is advised not to approach the car.
