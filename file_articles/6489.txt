San Diego Christian (3-6), a member of the NAIA, will not count Wednesday's result to its overall record per NAIA rules. The Hawks were overmatched in all phases.

They committed 18 turnovers that San Diego State turned into 29 points. The Hawks shot just 33.3 percent from the floor.

Marc Combs led San Diego Christian with 14 points, and he sank 2 of 4 3-point attempts. The rest of the Hawks shot 1 of 16 from deep. Bryce Parson and JaMario Harris both added six points.

One of just four undefeated teams remaining in Division I (along with No. 12 Auburn, Duquesne and Liberty), San Diego State can expect more resistance on Saturday when it faces Utah at Staples Center in Los Angeles. San Diego Christian opposes Cal State Maritime on Friday in El Cajon, Calif.
