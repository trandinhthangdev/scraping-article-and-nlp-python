Atletico Madrid are on the hunt to sign Nemanja Matic from Manchester United according to Sky Sports Italia.

The Red Devils midfielder's contract expires in the summer and can sign a pre-contract with clubs abroad.

The Serbia international has fallen out of favour under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, partly due to injuries.

Atletico also want Edinson Cavani and have reportedly agreed a three-year deal with the player.

The Uruguay international will also be a free agent in the summer when his contract expires.

Atletico will have to sell a number of players in order to fund the deal.

This is because the La Liga side believe they have too many players in the squad already and will have to cut down on their wage budget to afford Cavani.

Diego Simeone's side are working to bring in the PSG forward in January but they can agree a pre-contract for him to join in the summer for free anyway.

There is still no agreement with PSG to complete the deal in January as Atletico look to solve their striker crisis.
