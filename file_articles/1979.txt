Dynamite by name. Dynamite by explosion.

Daniel Dubois sent his Japanese opponent down and out for a fistful of ten counts as he turned up the thunderous tone of his warning to the Big Three of heavyweight boxing.

Kyotaro Fujimoto hit the deck in the Copper Box arena with a sickening thud in the second round.

The Japanese proved no match for Dynamite who made it 5 KOs from five fights this year

The 22-year-old is expected to face a tougher level of opponent with a Joe Joyce fight lined up

Referee Victor Laughlin spurned any count in preference for sending distress signals for a posse of medics to come into the ring and to the rescue of Japan’s first but already unconscious heavyweight of any note.

Not only would Joshua have heard the crash across London but also Fury and Wilder on the other side of the Atlantic.

‘Here I come,’ said Dubois in application for a world title challenge next year, at 22 and after just 14 wins, albeit three of them by KO.

Dubois started with dynamite intent but Fujimoto proved a trickier customer than expected, at first, dancing away to lessen the impact of those heavy rights.

The Dubois jab has been compared with some prime examples of that weapon in ring history and that ramrod left dropped the Japanese early in the second.

But it was that monster right which sent Fujimoto crashing to oblivion moments later.

Twenty-twenty here Dubois comes.
