Dec 19 (Reuters) - Former Everton and Manchester City midfielder Jack Rodwell is training with Sheffield United and Blades manager Chris Wilder is exploring the possibility of recruiting him in the January transfer window.

Rodwell, 28, has been without a club since leaving Blackburn Rovers at the end of his contract in the close season, and has been linked with Italian clubs Parma and AS Roma in recent months.

Last year, David McGoldrick was invited to train with Sheffield United when he was without a club, and the striker was offered a contract.

For now, Wilder said he will continue to monitor Rodwell's progress on the training pitch.

"It's not a trial. Jack is in for a few days," Wilder told reporters on Thursday.

"As you've seen in the past, David McGoldrick came in for a few days and Jack is looking at us and we are looking at Jack.

"He is obviously a very, very talented player who obviously should be playing in the Premier League regularly...he's looking for a home and it's something that might develop along the way."

Wilder revealed he is looking to add a few defensive-minded players in the midfield - a position where Rodwell has played for the majority of his career.

"People will try and put two and two together," said Wilder. "Defence and midfield are the main areas, just to strengthen and boost the squad for the second half of the season."

Sheffield United have been the surprise package on their return to the Premier League this season and they head into the weekend seventh in the table, just four points off the Champions League qualifying spots.

The Blades are hoping to extend their unbeaten run away from home in the competition when they face Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday. (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru Editing by Toby Davis)
