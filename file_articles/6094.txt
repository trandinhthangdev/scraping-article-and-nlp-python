ZAGREB, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Croatia's economic growth will slow in 2020 due to external risks and lack of domestic reforms to boost the business and investment climate, senior economists from Croatian banks said in a survey released on Thursday.

Growth is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2020 from 2.9% in 2019, according to the poll prepared by the Croatian Banking Association (HUB).

The forecasts are lower than projections released by the central bank this week which saw growth slowing from 3.0% in 2019 to 2.8% in 2020.

"Besides external risks, obstacles to investment, an inefficient public sector and unfavourable demographic trends are the key domestic weaknesses," the poll showed.

Croatia's key trade partners are fellow European Union members Italy and Germany and any slowdown in their economies would affect Croatia's growth.

In the last few years Croatia's economy largely relied on consumer spending and tourism receipts.

The chief economists of the major banks see a slowdown in consumer spending growth to 2.9% in 2020 from an expected 3.4% this year, while annual growth in investment is expected to fall to 5.7% from 7.4%.

The final economic growth figure for 2019 will be released in late February 2020. In the first nine months of this year the economy expanded 3.1% on an annual basis.

The chief economists also see this year's fiscal deficit at 0.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) widening to 0.4% in 2020, which is an election year.

The government plans this year a general budget gap of 0.1% of GDP turning into a surplus of 0.2% next year. (Reporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)
