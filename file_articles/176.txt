John Terry may be working in the Aston Villa dugout, but he showed he's still a Chelsea man at heart by taking a jibe at old rivals Tottenham on Instagram.

Chelsea dominated the London derby on Sunday, with the great English centre-back's former team-mate Frank Lampard guiding the Blues to a flawless performance, winning 2-0 on their first visit to the new stadium in N17.

Legendary Blues captain Terry was a central figure in countless fiery games between the sides, and couldn't resist sticking the boot in post-match.

Responding to a post on Chelsea's Instagram, Terry replied: 'Three points lane, some things never change.'

The West London side's fans have long referred to White Hart Lane as 'three point lane', reinforced by a 12-year unbeaten run in North London between 1989 and 2001 where Chelsea won nine out of 14 games.

In recent years Spurs have bitten back - winning three but still losing two home games.

Sunday's victory was extra sweet for Chelsea fans, as they celebrated handing Jose Mourinho his second defeat at Spurs.

Terry and Lampard shared some of their best years at Stamford Bridge under Mourinho in two trophy-laden spells.

Now, after taking charge at Manchester United and their fierce London rivals, the Portuguese's old 'Chelsea man' image has been tarnished.

Meanwhile, Terry's Villa sunk to a fourth-straight Premier League loss on Saturday - falling 3-1 to Southampton.

The Birmingham side now sit in the relegation zone, and all of the Blues legend's experience will have to be called on in their push for survival.
