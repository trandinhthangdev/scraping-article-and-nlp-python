At least two homes have been destroyed and six people have been taken to hospital following a fire in suburban Melbourne.

The blaze began after a gas cylinder exploded at a home on Webb Street, Seaford about 3:30pm on Friday and spread to other houses and an old factory nearby.

At least two homes were destroyed and three damaged, while helicopter footage showed multiple cars burnt out.

Six people were taken to Frankston Hospital, five of whom were suffering from smoke inhalation.

The other person suffered burns, an Ambulance Victoria spokeswoman confirmed. They are all in a stable condition.

The blaze has now been downgraded from a watch-and-act to an advice message.

"There is currently no threat to communities, but you should continue to stay informed and monitor conditions," the warning reads.

Firefighters will remain at the scene overnight.

Meanwhile, another home was destroyed by fire in Cairnlea, about 15 kilometres northwest of Melbourne.

More than 30 firefighters and an aircraft managed to stop the spread of the fire, which started at a home on Weaver Terrace home just before 5pm.
