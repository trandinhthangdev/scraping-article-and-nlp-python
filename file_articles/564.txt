Gone are the days of Zach Murray staying up late to watch the European Tour.

Rather than streaming it on his laptop, the Victorian golfer will be playing on it next year after earning a European Tour card by finishing second on the Australasian Tour's 2019 Order of Merit.

New Zealand's Ryan Fox topped the money list following the year-end Australian PGA Championship and will enjoy starts at the British Open and two World Golf Championship events next year as a result.

But with Fox's presence on the European Tour next season already secured, the eagerly-sought tour card went to second-placed Murray, who held off Brad Kennedy by just $9000.

Murray won the 2018 WA Open before turning professional and notching a wire-to-wire New Zealand Open victory in only his seventh pro start in March.

"Basically all year I've been thinking about this moment," 22-year-old Murray told the PGA website.

"I grew up watching the European Tour on TV at home.

"I'm a big golf fan, I watch a lot of golf. At events, I still whip out the laptop and watch it at night time.

"It's been a huge goal of mine for a long time, so I am fortunate to be in the position I'm in with the Order of Merit."

Fox began the Australian PGA Championship well clear in the merit standings and claimed that honour after placing tied 27th at Royal Pines.

Murray finished in a tie for 36th thanks to a closing 69.

"I was feeling a bit of pressure, as you do, but I played great the last six holes," he said.
