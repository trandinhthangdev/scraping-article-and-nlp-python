Unite branch chairman Alec McFadden was accused of inappropriately touching the woman as she got up from their table at the meal

An ally of Jeremy Corbyn was kicked out of his trade union job for allegedly slapping a woman’s bottom at a dinner attended by Labour leadership favourite Rebecca Long Bailey.

Unite branch chairman Alec McFadden was accused of inappropriately touching the woman as she got up from their table at the meal.

The incident was said to have happened at a restaurant after an anti-austerity march.

Mr McFadden strongly denied the allegation but lost his post as a branch chairman in the North West and faced two sets of disciplinary procedures from Unite.

Now, however, he has won his case against the trade union after arguing it should not have been allowed to pursue him twice over the same alleged incident, which occurred in October 2015.

Mr Justice Lavender concluded in an Employment Appeal Tribunal ruling published last week: ‘The union was not entitled to bring the second disciplinary proceedings.’

Unite will now have to pay Mr McFadden a ‘modest amount’ towards his legal costs.

It is another blow to Britain’s biggest trade union in the wake of Labour’s General Election humiliation. Last week it lost a libel case against former Redcar MP Anna Turley over an article on hard-Left website Skwawkbox.

Unite said last night it would appeal against the EAT ruling.
