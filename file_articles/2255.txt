NEWCASTLE, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Miguel Almiron's late goal sealed a 1-0 victory for Newcastle United in a dull game at St James' Park on Saturday.

Almiron finally broke his Newcastle duck in the 83rd minute of his 27th league appearance since joining from Atlanta United for 20 million pounds ($25.99 million), striking home left-footed.

The Paraguay international was on hand to convert after Andy Carroll had headed down inside a crowded area.

Victory saw Newcastle leapfrog Palace into the top-half of the table with 25 points from 18 games.

"I think the crowd showed their appreciation for him. I hadn't heard anything like it," Newcastle manager Steve Bruce said of the deafening roar that accompanied the goal.

"When he came to the club in January he lifted the place with his pace, trickery and skills. Unfortunately, he hadn't managed a goal but today he got it and we're delighted for him."

Newcastle, unbeaten at home since the first day of the season, moved up to ninth, only four points off the top four.

Palace had double the amount of goal attempts (16) as the home side but lacked a cutting edge.

"I'm sad we couldn't get more from the game. A point was the minimum we deserved," manager Roy Hodgson said.
