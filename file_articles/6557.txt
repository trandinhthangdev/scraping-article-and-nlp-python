Stanford quarterback K.J. Costello has entered his name into the NCAA transfer portal, according to multiple published reports.

Costello is listed as a graduate transfer, which would allow him to play in 2020, according to Bleacher Report and other media outlets. Costello was a second-team All-Pac 12 selection in 2018 but appeared in only five games during an injury riddled 2019 campaign.

In his career at Stanford, Costello has completed 62.5 percent of his passes for 6,141 yards, 49 touchdowns and 18 interceptions. He is one of nine quarterbacks in school history to eclipse 6,000 passing yards.

The 6-foot-5, 220-pound Costello was ranked by Rivals as the nation's second-best pro-style quarterback recruit when he joined Stanford in 2016.
