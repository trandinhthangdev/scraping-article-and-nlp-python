The Victoria's Secret fashion show may be cancelled, but Kelly Gale has proven she doesn't need the runway to court attention.

Known for her proclivity to pose in skimpy attire, the 24-year-old model took to Instagram on Monday to share a glimpse at one of her raunchiest looks ever.

In a gallery of candid photos, the Swedish-Australian stunner was pictured lying in a hot tub wearing an eye-popping pair of ruched G-string bikini bottoms.

The rainbow garment left very little to the imagination, thanks to it's extremely narrow-cut front section.

On top, the raven-haired glamazon wore a comparatively modest triangle bikini halter in bright yellow.

Clutching a martini glass as she posed with her legs akimbo, Kelly wrote in the caption: 'No more work in 2019, cheers!'
