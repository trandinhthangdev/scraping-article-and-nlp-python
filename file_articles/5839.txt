Worshippers are flocking to a church to see a nativity scene because they claim a shepherd boy is the spitting image of Boris Johnson.

Queues of people have been visiting St Mildred's Church in Tenterden, Kent, after the Rev Canon Lindsay Hammond pointed out the likeness to his congregation.

He says ever since he mentioned how the shepherd boy - complete with a mop of unruly blonde hair - was a dead ringer for the Prime Minister, the church has seen visitor numbers rocket as they queue to get a peek.

The Rev Hammond said: 'When I mentioned the figure's likeness to Boris in the Sunday service people were queuing up afterwards to get a look at him.

'With the election fresh in everybody's mind and Boris's victory, the shepherd boy has been seen in a new light - and maybe we will see start to see a pilgrimage to the shrine of St Boris at St Mildred's.'

Locals in the area, which is represented by Tory MP Damian Green, said it was 'great' to have Boris in their church.

Malcolm Forbes, 49, said: 'It's great to have Boris nearby, even if he is a shepherd boy - now he can shepherd us out of Europe.'

Another added: 'Good old Boris - he gets everywhere.'

Not everyone agrees, however. Claire Simons said: 'I've seen enough of Boris and every other politician, I don't want to be thinking about any of them in church.'
