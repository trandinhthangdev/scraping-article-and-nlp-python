The show brings many complex topics to light, with many pertaining to the current state of Hollywood in the post-#MeToo era.

'We see you and we stand with you,' Witherspoon added.

Head-to-head: Aniston, role of Levy and Witherspoon, role of Jackson, are put against one another in the realm of Morning news

The program, created by Jay Carson, aimed to to give audiences an inside look at the morning television personalities that 'help them wake-up.'

Aniston stars as Alex Levy, a long-running morning news anchor whose co-host Mitch Kessler, played by Steve Carell, was fired from the Morning TV program due to a slew of 'sexual misconduct' allegations made against him.

After fifteen years of network domination and the dismissal of her on-air partner, Levy stands the chance of losing her morning news throne to an up-and-coming - and much younger - reporter, Bradley Jackson, played by Witherspoon.

The Morning Show follows the rivalry between Levy and Jackson as tension heats up at the network.

The entire series is available for streaming on Apple TV+.
