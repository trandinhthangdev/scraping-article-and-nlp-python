Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. weighed in over the specified limit Thursday, but his fight against Daniel Jacobs will go on as scheduled Saturday in Phoenix.

The bout was scheduled to be contested at 168 pounds, but Chavez weighed in at 172.7 pounds. Jacobs weighed in at 167.9 pounds.

ESPN.com and the Los Angeles Times reported that in the wake of the weight gaffe, Chavez agreed to hand over $1 million of his roughly $3 million payday to Jacobs in order to have the fight proceed.

Both boxers are former middleweight champions.

Chavez, a 33-year-old Mexico native, has a 51-3-1 record with 33 knockouts. He dropped a unanimous decision to Canelo Alvarez in May 2017, then didn't fight again until knocking out Evert Bravo in the 10th round in August 2019.

Jacobs, a 32-year-old New York native, has a 35-3 record with 29 knockouts. He lost a unanimous decision to Alvarez in May in his most recent fight.
