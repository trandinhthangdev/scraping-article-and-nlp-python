Rebecca Lobie isn't shy in showing off her fabulous curves.

And on Sunday, the 32-year-old niece of late wildlife warrior Steve Irwin raised eyebrows with her latest Instagram photo.

The blonde beauty flaunted her ample bust in a skimpy blue bikini, as she relaxed on a Gold Coast beach.

That'll get the likes! Steve Irwin's 'hot niece' Rebecca Lobie, 32, (pictured) flaunted her ample bust in a VERY skimpy bikini for a day at the beach, in a photo shared to Instagram on Sunday

Rebecca aimed her iPhone above her head, ensuring she captured the perfect angle of her toned figure.

She arched her back slightly, and concealed her gaze behind tinted sunglasses.

Rebecca's makeup consisted of a matte foundation and a slick of pink colour on her plump pout.

Hinting at having been under the weather, Rebecca captioned the photo: 'A week in bed... needing some sunshine.'

Rising star: It appears her newfound fame has come at a cost, with Rebecca last month pleading with Instagram trolls to stop sending her abusive messages

The mother-of-two rose to prominence in September thanks to her sexy snapshots and connection to the Irwin family.

But it appears her newfound fame has come at a cost, with Rebecca last month pleading with Instagram trolls to stop sending her abusive messages.

'To all the people that think it's OK to post mean comments about me, or worse, my family - it's NOT,' she wrote.

Here's mummy: Rebecca is married to car enthusiast Mick Lobie, and they share two young sons (pictured)

'Stop being bullies. If you don't like me or my Insta, don't go on it. To everyone else, thank you for your support. Love you.'

Rebecca is the daughter of Frank Muscillo, who is married to Steve Irwin's sister, Joy.

She is married to car enthusiast Mick Lobie, and they share two young sons.

According to her LinkedIn account, Rebecca was previously managing director of the Irwin family's Australia Zoo, but left in December 2015.
