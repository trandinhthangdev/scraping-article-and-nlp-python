Images of the Address Downtown engulfed in flames were beamed around the world after it caught fire on New Year’s Eve in 2015

British engineering giant WS Atkins is being sued over a huge fire that broke out at a Dubai hotel it designed, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Images of the Address Downtown engulfed in flames were beamed around the world after it caught fire at around 9pm on New Year’s Eve in 2015.

The fire was contained to the outside of the building, which sits in the shadows of the world’s tallest building – the Burj Khalifa. There were only minor injuries.

WS Atkins designed and oversaw construction of the building, owned by Emaar Properties, the Dubai property giant.

Atkins, which was bought by Canada’s SNC-Lavalin in 2017 for £2.1billion, is now facing legal action in Dubai for its role in the fire. SNC-Lavalin’s financial reports reveal the claimant, understood to be Emaar, is seeking damages for lost income and refurbishment costs. The claim accuses Atkins of ‘negligence in the specification, testing and installation of the building cladding which is claimed to have exacerbated the fire, thereby increasing the damage to the building’, SNC said in its report. The size of the claim is unknown.

Separately, last week a division of SNC-Lavalin pleaded guilty to fraud related to its work in Libya over the last decade.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau became embroiled in the SNC-Lavalin affair after he was accused of interfering in the scandal.

WS Atkins declined to comment.
