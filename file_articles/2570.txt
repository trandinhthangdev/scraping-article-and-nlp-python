Tottenham reportedly want to sign West Ham defender Issa Diop as a replacement for centre back Jan Vertonghen.

Diop, 22, has three and a half years left on his contract and the Hammers are reluctant to sell him.

Spurs will have to reach into their pockets if they want Diop, who is currently valued at £50million, in January, report Sky Sports.

The Frenchman joined West Ham from Ligue 1 side Toulouse 18 months ago for £22m.

Spurs boss Jose Mourinho has his first chance to make additions to the Tottenham side he inherited since taking over from the sacked Mauricio Pochettino.

However, pursuing Diop does not change Mourinho's stance on Vertonghen, who he wants to sign a new deal for the club.

Toby Alderweireld signed a new contract with Spurs this week that keeps him at the club until 2023 and Mourinho wants Vertonghen to follow suit.
