Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists Paul Pogba will not be sold in the January transfer window – but is no longer certain Manchester United's record signing will play again this year.

Pogba is again being linked with a move away from Old Trafford after two-and-a-half months out with an ankle injury.

However, Solskjaer said: 'He's not getting sold in January. He's training, but he's not been training with us for long. He's training and that's a step forward for us.

'He's a fantastic player, a charismatic personality and for us we're happy that he's here.'

Pogba has not played since the end of September and was due to make his comeback in time for the Christmas period, but Solskjaer admits that might not happen after the player's return to training was held up by illness.

'I hope so still but let's see how he feels,' added the United boss.

'I'm not going to push him. We need him to be 100 per cent fit.

'The injury was something that really needed sorting but I don't think I should give you all the medical information but he's now feeling good and getting better – it's worked.

'Paul has been fantastic and we've got one of the best players in the world when he plays well and gets fit. He needs time.'

'Nemanja (Matic) is back and Paul's coming back, so we're not as light as we were, say a month ago. We're looking stronger like when we started the season.'
