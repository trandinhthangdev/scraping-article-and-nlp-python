A man has been charged in Sydney with the brutal sexual abuse of a young woman that allegedly escalated over months.

The 22-year-old is charged with multiple counts of rape, choking, and distributing images without consent after he allegedly began abusing the woman, whom he knew, in August.

Police will allege in court the violence escalated before the man sexually assaulted the woman at a function in the Sydney CBD on November 12, and later threatened her over the phone.

He was arrested at a Strathfield home in Sydney's inner west on December 16.

The man was charged with 17 offences, including two counts of aggravated sexual assault involving bodily harm, seven counts of intercourse without consent, and choking, touching and distributing intimate images without consent.

He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear in the Central Local Court on February 20.
