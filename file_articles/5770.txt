Bristol Rovers have been fined £7,500 and ordered to implement an action plan after some of their supporters sung homophobic chanting during the Carabao Cup clash with Brighton in August.

Rovers admitted a charge of failing to ensure that its spectators conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and refrained from using abusive and/or insulting words, which included a reference, whether express or implied, to sexual orientation.

The incident occurred during Rovers' 2-1 home defeat by Premier League side Brighton in the second round of the Carabao Cup on August 27.

The police report from the game said a large number of younger Bristol Rovers fans were involved in the chanting, and the commission found evidence of 'four or five audible chants each lasting for a relatively short period of time resulting in a considerable cumulative total of inappropriate chanting'.

The commission also said there was 'no doubt' that there were 'a string of failures in Bristol Rovers' delivery of proper and safe stewarding'.

Rovers were praised for the steps they have since taken in addressing the issues, but have been ordered to implement a 12-point action plan.

Steps include to initiate a review into the quality of steward training, for Rovers' safety officer to visit other clubs to obtain best practice policies and for them to work more closely with anti-discrimination group Kick It Out.
