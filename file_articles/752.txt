GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) - Adam Scott won the Australian PGA on Sunday at Royal Pines for his 30th professional victory and first in almost four years.

The 39-year-old Australian closed with a 3-under 69 for a two-stroke victory over New Zealand's Michael Hendry.

"I'm stoked. This has been a long time coming and I'm really happy to win another PGA here. It finishes off a nice year for me," Scott said. "It's been a long time between drinks for me and maybe only once or twice did the thought cross my mind that I'll never win again. It's very difficult to win and I'm on the wrong side of this age thing now."

Scott finished at 13-under 275. He also won the 2013 event at Royal Pines.

Hendry shot a 69.
