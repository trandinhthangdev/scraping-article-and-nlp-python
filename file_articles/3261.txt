BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - A Hungarian lawmaker said Friday he is resigning from parliament after being accused of sexual harassment to avoid damaging his political party.

In an an interview with broadcaster ATV, Zsolt Greczy denied the allegations but said he was resigning to avoid burdening his left-wing opposition party, the Democratic Coalition.

A female parliamentary adviser to a right-wing lawmaker accused him of making numerous unwanted advances, while an anonymous sender emailed explicit photos of Greczy to Hungarian media, claiming to have received them from him.

Greczy, who will step down on Dec. 31, said the allegations were linked to the increasing popularity of his party, led by former Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany. Greczy said he considered himself a victim of the scandal.

"I'm not dealing with this matter anymore," Greczy replied when asked whether he had sent the explicit photographs to someone or they were stolen from him. "I never harassed anyone."

The victory of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party in October's nationwide municipal elections was much narrower than expected, in part due to a sex scandal involving one of the party's most prominent mayors, Zsolt Borkai, a former Olympic champion in gymnastics.

Borkai was reelected in Ocotber, but resigned shortly after the elections.
