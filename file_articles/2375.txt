The Oklahoma Sooners will reportedly be without a key defensive player when they face No. 1 LSU in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta on Dec. 28.

Safety Delarrin Turner-Yell, the team's second-leading tackler, will miss the game with a broken collarbone, according to ESPN.

Turner-Yell, a sophomore, had 75 tackles and three passes defensed in 13 starts this season.

Earlier this week it was reported that the No. 4 Sooners would also be without three suspended players -- starting defensive end Ronnie Perkins, running back Rhamondre Stevenson and receiver Trejan Bridges.

The Peach Bowl winner advances to the championship game on Jan. 13 to meet either No. 2 Ohio State or No. 3 Clemson.

It was unclear whether the suspensions would extend to the championship game, should Oklahoma advance, and no reason for the suspensions has been released.

Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley declined to comment on the topic during a news conference for National Signing Day on Wednesday.

"I'm aware of the report that is out there," Riley said. "Unfortunately at this time, I cannot comment on it."

Riley isn't scheduled to speak with the media again until next week in Atlanta.

Perkins, a sophomore, has 38 tackles (13.5 for loss), six sacks and six quarterback hurries in 13 starts this season.

Stevenson, a junior, saw his workload increase after tailback Trey Sermon suffered a season-ending injury. In 13 games, he carried the ball 64 times for 575 yards, scoring six touchdowns.

Bridges, a freshman, contributed seven catches for 82 yards -- two of them touchdowns -- this season.
