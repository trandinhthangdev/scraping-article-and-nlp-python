A school teacher has been jailed for a range of child sex offences after he filmed young girls getting changed.

Leigh Herman Moir, 28, from Queensland, was found guilty of 55 charges including inappropriately touching young girls' breasts and buttocks, and making exploitative videos.

Queensland District Court Judge Craig Chowdhury sentenced Moir to six years’ jail for maintaining an unlawful relationship with a child and a further two years’ jail for 48 charges of indecent treatment of children.

Some of the children were under the age of 12.

Moir was sacked from a private college south of Brisbane that cannot be identified for legal reasons, as soon as the allegations came to light.

The court heard Moir had accessed child pornography, and made a student take his mobile phone into the girls’ change rooms at the school to film them.

He had also inappropriately touched young girls on the breasts and buttocks.

Moir committed the crimes in multiple locations including at a church in Birkdale which he had attended for seven years from when his victims were as young as six.

Some of the crimes were committed at his home and others at the school.

Moir will be eligible to apply for parole in 15 months after Judge Craig Chowdhury ruled his sentences would be served concurrently, the Courier Mail reported.

Shocked parents of the victims have lodged an appeal against the leniency of the sentence.

'When we heard the crimes read out in court, it was horrifying and sickening,' one said.

The college told the Courier Mail that it had ongoing staff training on mandatory reporting of inappropriate behaviour.

It said parents had been contacted as soon as the school was made aware of the allegations and given counselling, and also referred to Queensland Police.
