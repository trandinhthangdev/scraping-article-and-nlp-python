MOSCOW, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Gunshots were heard in central Moscow near the headquarters of Russia's FSB security service on Thursday evening after the agency was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying it had neutralized an attacker and several people had been wounded.

Screams were heard by a Reuters reporter on the scene, with authorities widening a cordoned-off area and telling passers-by to get away from the scene. (Reporting by Anton Zverev and Andrey Ostroukh; Writing by Polina Ivanova Editing by Andrew Osborn)
