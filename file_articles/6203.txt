The chief executive and chief financial officer of Royal Bank of Scotland's underperforming investment banking arm have stepped down, the bank announced today.

In the first significant move announced since new RBS chief executive Alison Rose started, Chris Marks and Richard Place have quit as bosses of Natwest Markets.

It comes after the division has underperformed recently, contributing to tipping taxpayer-backed RBS to a loss in the third quarter, with shareholders calling on the bank to scale it back.

Shake-up: Chris Marks and Richard Place have quit as bosses of Natwest Markets

Marks has been replaced on an interim basis by Robert Begbie, RBS treasurer, and will stay until June, while Place has been replaced by Robert Horrocks, RBS treasury finance director and will stay until March.

Meanwhile, the bank has launched an internal and external search for permanent replacements.

Rose, who became RBS' first ever female boss at the end of October, is expected to unveil a new strategy alongside the bank's full-year results in February.

Speaking of the two departing bosses, she said: 'They have set the foundations for the continuing transformation and simplification across NatWest Markets as RBS has been re-shaped to focus on serving its customers in the UK and Ireland, whilst also managing complex organisational changes around ring-fencing and Brexit.'

In the third quarter of this year, RBS, which owns the Natwest brand, swung to a loss of £8million.

Poor performance from Natwest Markets was to blame, as well as was an extra £900million to cover a last-minute rush of PPI claims.
