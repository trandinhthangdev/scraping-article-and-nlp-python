Michigan State senior guard Joshua Langford is out for the season after he underwent surgery on his injured left foot, coach Tom Izzo announced Thursday.

Langford never got into a game this season. He was limited to 13 games last season because of a stress fracture in his left foot that required surgery and caused him to miss the Spartans' run to the Big Ten tournament title and the Final Four.

His last game for the Spartans was in an 88-60 victory against Northern Illinois on Dec. 29, 2018, when he sat out the second half after scoring three points.

He began experiencing pain in the foot again during preseason practice, with tests revealing what Izzo said was a stress reaction in Langford's left foot.

The 6-foot-5 Langford averaged 15.0 points in 13 games last season, shooting 40.3 percent from 3-point range. He has a career average of 10.2 points with 40.7 percent accuracy from beyond the arc (110 of 270) in 83 games (75 starts).

Before he got hurt, he played in 83 consecutive games for the Spartans, who were ranked No. 1 in the AP preseason poll.

Michigan State (8-3), now ranked No. 15 in the country, is 2-0 in the Big Ten, the lone undefeated team in the league after beating Northwestern 77-72 on Wednesday. The Spartans' next game is Saturday against Eastern Michigan.
