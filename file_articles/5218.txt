Red Bull Salzburg jokingly called out Liverpool after Takumi Minamino became their third former player to join the Reds in the past four years.

The Japanese attacker will join fellow Salzburg alumni Naby Keita and Sadio Mane at the club when he officially completes his £7.25million move from Austria on January 1, 2020.

That continues the trend of Liverpool buying a former Red Bull Salzburg player every two years, having snapped up Mane from Southampton for £34m in 2016 and Keita two years later from RB Leipzig for £48m.

Mane originally joined the Austrian Bundesliga giants in 2012, spending two seasons there and registering 45 goals in 87 games before the Premier League came calling.

Red Bull Salzburg also played a key role in shaping Keita, the midfielder making 80 appearances and impressing enough to seal a move to sister club RB Leipzig in 2016.

They will now be joined by Minamino, the first to join directly from Salzburg, having impressed against Liverpool across two Champions League group stage games earlier this season.

The Japanese international can play across attacking midfield and has nine goals to his name so far for the club, an indication of his prowess inside the box.
