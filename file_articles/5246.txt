Sofia Vergara has reportedly met with the producers of America's Got Talent.

The 47-year-old is 'poised to fill' one of the two seats left open after NBC opted not to bring back Gabrielle Union and Julianne Hough, according to TMZ.

The Modern Family actress 'met with 'AGT' honchos Wednesday for 2 hours' claimed the gossip site.

Union, 47, lost her job after she reportedly complained of racial bias and a 'toxic' work culture at the NBC show.

She hinted at her AGT booting at her New York And Company holiday collection launch in Manhattan on Sunday.

'Don’t be the happy negro that does the bidding of the status quo because you’re afraid,' she said at the launch without naming the TV program, Variety reports.

'Don’t allow them to call you angry when someone else is called passionate. It’s terrifying. There’s a solid chance you’ll lose your job.…I speak from experience.'

The network also opted not to renew the contract of Union's fellow judge Julianne Hough.
