The neighbour of an elderly widow has been charged with her murder, more than eight months after she was found dead inside her Melbourne home.

Stuart Anderson was arrested and charged on Friday with one count of murder.

The 39-year-old spoke to the media shortly after 77-year-old Vicki Ramadan was found dead in her Sydenham home on April 6, claiming to have discovered her body in the hallway, with her backdoor broken into.

She was believed to have been dead for days.

Anderson did not appear when his matter was briefly mentioned in Melbourne Magistrates Court on Friday.

He will be back before the court on Monday.
