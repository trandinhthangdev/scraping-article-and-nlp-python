Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle Al Woods has been suspended four games by the NFL for violating the league's performance-enhancing drug policy, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Friday.

The NFL has yet to publicly announce the suspension as of Friday afternoon.

Woods stepped into the starting role for five games after fellow defensive tackle Jarran Reed was suspended for a violation of the league's personal conduct policy.

The 32-year-old Woods recorded 32 tackles and one sack in 14 games this season.

Woods collected 204 tackles and 5.5 sacks in 125 career games with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Pittsburgh Steelers, Tennessee Titans, Indianapolis Colts and Seahawks.
