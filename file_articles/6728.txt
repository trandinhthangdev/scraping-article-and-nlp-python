Parents are furious after schools banned packed lunches to reduce plastic waste.

The HEART Education Trust said it would make a ‘positive difference to preserving the planet for our children’.

School bosses claimed the free hot meals will be more nutritious. But parents branded the move condescending and some fear their children will refuse to eat the dinners and end up hungry.

After the Christmas break, all children aged four to seven will be forced to have a hot lunch provided by the school.

And the trust said any packed lunches taken in will be returned. It affects four primaries in Norwich, Norfolk.

Now 500 parents have signed a petition set up by Sam Gravener, 28, whose son Fred attends one school.

She wrote: ‘Removing a parent and child’s choice on what they eat is wrong.’

Trust boss Hazel Cubbage said: ‘It seems ridiculous for parents to struggle to plan and pay for lunches when we can provide them for free.’

A letter sent out on December 16 informed parents of the decision to commission Norse Catering to provide the lunches.

It said the change will come in from January 6, and that children will get a choice of four options from a ‘new lunch menu’.

‘Alternatively, if you really feel your child will not benefit from one of the four nutritious choices on the menu, you may take them home for lunch,’ it said.
