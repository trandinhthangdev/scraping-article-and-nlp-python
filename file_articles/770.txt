The strength of a troubled central Queensland dam falls below the required safety rating, according to a new report by the state's Inspector-General for Emergency Management.

Paradise Dam, and the community affected by it, have undergone a readiness report in the months following the release of 100,000 megalitres of water for safety reasons.

The report covers dam safety issues, disaster management arrangements and community readiness, and follows warnings the dam wall has an "unacceptable" risk of breaking apart during an extreme weather event.

The strength of the dam's spillway has been deemed an unacceptable risk to the community.

This failure was made worse by damage to the bottom of the dam during a flood in 2013.

While the report says dam operator Sunwater has appropriately been dealing with the aftermath of the 2013 flood, more needs to be done to improve community consultation and preparedness for such an event.

The report also found Sunwater and local government areas affected by the dam's failure did not properly consult with each other when performing flood modelling.

There are 33 findings and 17 recommendations in the report relating to dam safety, disaster management arrangements, emergency communications, community readiness and lessons management.

The major focus of the recommendations regards community consultation to ensure residents have an emergency plan in the event of another flood.

A separate inquiry will look at the structural issues facing the dam.

That report is due to be handed to the state government in April, according to Natural Resources Minister Anthony Lynham.

"That will tell us what actually happened with the dam, why we have a situation where we have a dam which is relatively young causing us all these concerns," Dr Lynham said on Monday.

Dr Lynham said the dam was safe for weather events forecast this summer.
