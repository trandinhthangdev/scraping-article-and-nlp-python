Injured pacemen Dale Steyn and Nathan Coulter-Nile will miss another game for Melbourne Stars, ensuring Pakistani Haris Rauf will have another chance to impress in Sunday's BBL clash with Hobart.

Rauf, plucked from grade cricket in Hobart on the eve of the BBL when it became clear Steyn wouldn't be fit for the Stars' season-opener because of a side strain, excelled on debut.

Rauf, having snared 2-20 in the Stars' victory over Brisbane Heat on the Gold Coast, has been retained in a 13-man squad for Sunday's match in Moe.

The 26-year-old, who captured the prized scalp of Hobart Hurricanes opener D'Arcy Short during his stint with Glenorchy, will once again be asked to fill the void left by his idol Steyn.

"He's brought some good energy to the group," Stars legspinner Adam Zampa said.

"If Dale doesn't come up to scratch, we know we've got someone ready and bowling really well.

"The best thing about getting guys like that is that they have something to prove. You know they're always going to have a real crack,

"He's fast, he nails his yorker, he's got a pretty good slower ball. I think he's a very good find for us."

Zampa claimed the game-changing wicket of Tom Banton for 64 on Friday night, helping steer the Stars to a victory that was set up by Glenn Maxwell's stunning 83 in his return from a mental health break.

"The last few years we've started off pretty poorly with a couple of losses," Zampa said.

"The way Tom Banton was going, to bring it back and bowl really well in the middle and end up winning the game is a really good start to the season."
