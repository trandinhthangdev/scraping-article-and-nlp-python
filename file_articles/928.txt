Justice Hill added a rushing touchdown for Baltimore (13-2), which extended its franchise record with its 11th win in a row.

Baker Mayfield tossed one touchdown apiece to tight end Demetrius Harris and wideout Odell Beckham Jr. for Cleveland (6-9), which lost for the third time in its past four games. The Browns guaranteed a sub-.500 season for the 12th year in a row.

The Browns opened the scoring with 11:53 remaining in the second quarter when Mayfield found Harris for a 1-yard score. It was Harris' third touchdown reception of the season, matching his career high from 2018. Moments later, Austin Seibert missed an extra-point attempt to keep the score at 6-0.

The Ravens pulled in front 7-6 with 1:18 left in the second quarter. Jackson spotted Andrews running down the right seam and hit him with a pinpoint pass for a 39-yard touchdown.

Jackson connected with Andrews for a second touchdown to make it 14-6 with nine seconds to go before halftime. The play increased Andrews' touchdown total to 10 and gave him two multi-touchdown performances this season.

Midway through the third quarter, the Ravens increased their lead to 21-6. Jackson tossed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Ingram, who tied a single-season franchise record with his 15th score (10 rushing, five receiving).

A 47-yard field goal by Seibert cut the Browns' deficit to 21-9 late in the third quarter.

Baltimore responded with its own field goal, a 31-yarder by Justin Tucker, to make it 24-9 with 11:34 left in the fourth quarter.

Cleveland pulled within 24-15 when Beckham hauled in a 3-yard touchdown pass from Mayfield with 8:01 to play. The Browns tried for a two-point conversion on the next play, but Mayfield's pass fell incomplete.
