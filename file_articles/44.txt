The England and Wales Cricket Board has confirmed it is “open to discussions” about taking part in a new four-nation tournament.

Reports from India have emerged suggesting England, India and Australia are ready to commit to the limited-overs competition on an annual basis.

Sourav Ganguly, president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, has been quoted by a publication in Kolkata that the three nations and one other invited country will take part in the inaugural ‘Super Series’ in 2021.

The ECB revealed that talks have been held on the subject but also suggested the details have yet to be settled.

“We meet regularly with other leaders from the major cricketing nations to share learnings and discuss topics that impact our sport,” said a statement.

“A four-nation tournament was raised at a meeting with the BCCI in December and we are open to discussions with other ICC members to see if this concept can develop.”

Any such progress would meet with considerable scepticism, given the opposition and ultimate abandonment of the so-called ‘big three takeover’ in 2014.

That model saw global revenues poured more heavily towards the richest nations, given they also brought in the greatest commercial interest.

The International Cricket Council has since moved towards a wider distribution model, though many national boards still struggle financially.
