Chaundee Brown scored 25 points and Wake Forest survived a scare from visiting North Carolina A&T before pulling out a 76-64 victory on Saturday afternoon in Winston-Salem, N.C.

Olivier Sarr's 13 points and 10 rebounds also gave Wake Forest a boost as it won consecutive games for the first time this month. Brown also had 10 rebounds.

The Demon Deacons (7-5) posted their first undefeated nonconference home mark in three years, winning all four outings. Wake Forest won't play again for two weeks when it enters the girth of its Atlantic Coast Conference schedule.

Ronald Jackson scored 12 of his 16 points in the first half for N.C. A&T (3-10), which lost its fourth straight game. Fred Cleveland Jr. added 15 points off the bench. Jackson pulled in 11 rebounds.

N.C. A&T was up 49-48 with less than 12 minutes to play. Wake Forest went ahead by five, but Cleveland's 3 tied the score at 59-59 at the 7:38 mark. It was tied again with six minutes left.

Brown's three-point play pushed Wake Forest's edge to 66-61 with 4:14 to go. Cleveland answered with a 3-pointer.

The Demon Deacons scored the next eight points on the way to a 74-64 lead by the 36.9-second mark and added two more to conclude the contest.

N.C. A&T missed three straight free throws in the last 6 1/2 minutes.

The Aggies led 25-24 with less than eight minutes to play in the first half. N.C. A&T went almost six minutes without a field goal as Wake Forest crept to a 35-29 edge.

The margin reached 41-34 at halftime, with Aggies charged with 10 turnovers.

N.C. A&T fell to 0-43 all-time against Atlantic Coast Conference teams, including 0-6 against Wake Forest. This matched the closest final margin for a N.C. A&T-Wake Forest game, with the same spread as last year.

Sarr, a center, played for the first time in two weeks after missing last week's upset of then-No. 23 Xavier because he was in the concussion protocol.
