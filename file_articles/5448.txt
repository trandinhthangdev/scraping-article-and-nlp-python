West Ham are among the clubs monitoring developments with Stoke City midfielder Joe Allen.

The Wales international midfielder could be sold in January as part of a cost cutting exercise with manager Michael O'Neill under orders to trim the wage bill.

Stoke want £15million for Allen, 29, who is on around £65,000 per week, yet West Ham are looking to pay closer to £8m. Stoke had interest from Burnley in the summer who remain admirers but are reluctant to match the figures.

Allen was previously a target for West Ham when David Moyes was manager and has also drawn attention from Wolves and Newcastle United.

He has fallen foul of some Stoke fans recently, cupping his ears while celebrating a goal against Luton Town in reaction to abuse he and teammates had received during the game.

Stoke expect interest in goalkeeper Jack Butland, also an option for West Ham, while Badou Ndiaye is wanted in Turkey by Trabzonspor and midfielders Mark Duffy and Peter Etebo are also available.
