Watford host Manchester United at Vicarage Road today in Premier League action.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men will move into fifth place for a few hours at least with a win whilst narrowing the gap to one point of Chelsea sitting in the top four in the league table.

The Hornets are already nine points adrift of safety and are desperate for any points.

Sportsmail's Adam Shergold will provide live coverage of Watford vs Man United including score, lineups and build-up.
