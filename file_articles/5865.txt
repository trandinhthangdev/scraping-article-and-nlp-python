Her daughter Pixie Curtis is already the face of a multimillion-dollar empire at the tender age of eight.

And now Roxy Jacenko's son Hunter, six, is keen on getting into the family business.

On Thursday, the 39-year-old PR dynamo took to Instagram to share a hilarious clip of Hunter acting as a 'temp' at her company, Sweaty Betty PR.

Man at work! Roxy Jacenko's son Hunter, six, (pictured) works as a 'temp' at Sweaty Betty PR when her husband Oliver Curtis 'doesn't show up'

In the clip, Hunter pretends to be on the phone, before suddenly hanging up and starting to giggle.

'When @1903oprc doesn’t show up, I call in a temp,' she captioned the post, tagging her husband Oliver Curtis.

It comes after Roxy shared several videos and photos to Instagram on Saturday that showed Pixie and Hunter running around the lush grounds of a stunning estate in the country.

In one clip, Hunter squealed in delight as he discovered a serene pool.

'You are joking? Look down here!' the little man cried out to Pixie, 'They gave us actually a pool!'

Beyond, lay towering eucalyptus tress and a stunning view of what appeared to be a mountain vista.

The siblings appeared to love their weekend digs, in one photo giggling as they jumped on a trampoline.
