With a rebranding and a move to a bigger venue already complete, the Chicago Fire now have a new sporting director in Georg Heitz, who was most recently with the club team FC Basel in Switzerland.

The 50-year-old Heitz has plenty to do ahead of training camp, which is set to begin on Jan. 18. The Fire still does not have a head coach, they have no designated players and the roster is comprised of just 17 players.

At least the Fire have a new color scheme, announced during the offseason. A move out of the Chicago suburbs and back into Soldier Field, home of the NFL's Chicago Bears, will also happen in 2020.

"I have one principle: no excuses, no alibis," Heitz said, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. "We're all professionals. We are paid to make the right decisions. I don't think too much about facts we cannot change. It is clear that we want to reach the playoffs next season, and from then on anything is possible. We will improve in the upcoming months. Be sure we will improve."

The Fire were 10-12-12 (42 points) during the 2019 season and just missed out on advancing into the expanded playoff field. The Fire last advanced to the playoffs in the 2017 season.

Heitz revealed that he is looking for a coach with an active, offensive and entertaining style. A decision is expected soon.

"We are already talking to candidates, more than one," said Heitz, who guided FC Basel to eight league titles, three Swiss Cups and six UEFA Champions League appearances in nine seasons. "I like to work with profiles when it comes to players, but also when it comes to coaches. We have made a profile and now we are having talks."
