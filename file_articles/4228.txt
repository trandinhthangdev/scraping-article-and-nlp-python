Harry Styles has been branded 'childish and petulant' after chanting 'f*** the government and f*** Boris' on stage with Stormzy last night.

The One Direction star threw his arms in the air and yelled the politically-charged Vossi Bop lyric at the top of his voice during an intimate gig at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, north London.

In the wake of the Prime Minister's thumping election win, it pours petrol on already simmering feelings that the millionaire celebrity class is growing evermore out of touch with ordinary Britons.

Styles, who is worth an estimated £68million and lives in a plush Hampstead mansion, revealed in 2015 he supports Labour because he is 'for the people'.

But people on social media rounded on the singer's sweary anti-Tory outburst and accused him of being a 'middle-class socialist' and having a 'leftie meltdown'.

It came after Stormzy, who is an outspoken supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, found himself in hot water this week after telling primary school children 'Boris is a bad bad man'.

Styles, who grew up in a leafy Cheshire village, shot to international superstardom after appearing on the X Factor in 2010 and has since enjoyed both staggering chart success and eye-watering wealth.

But unlike Stormzy, who uses his platform to bang the drum for Labour, the Sign Of The Times hitmaker has not voiced his political beliefs on stage - until last night.

The performance sparked a furious online backlash.

GMB presenter Piers Morgan, who criticised Stormzy earlier this week, sarcastically tweeted 'soooo edgy' with a yawning emoji.

Andy Bath posted: 'Shouting f*** you sounds rather childish and petulant, the level of playground tantrums or stamping your feet and screaming till you're sick.

'I thought winning the GE [general election] was great but it's the gift that keeps on giving, the lefties are having a meltdown, it's hilarious.'

Another wrote: 'Irrespective of the political views they share, this is disgraceful. Young boys and girls are looking at them as role models. This isn't going to send any positive or good messages.'

Footage of the gig shows Styles, 25, dressed in a cream suit and tie, and Stormzy, 26, dressed in black jeans and t-shirt, jumping around on stage during a rendition of the grime star's 2019 Number One.

As Stormzy spits the bars, Styles duets on a few lines but mainly sways to the side of him in front of the 1,500 crowd.

In the lead up to the infamous lyric, Stormzy sings: 'Rule Number two don't make the promise.

'If you can't keep a deal then just be honest. I can never die I'm Chuck Norris.'

At this point, Styles steps up to his microphone, and lets out a cry to hype up the crowd in anticipation.

He then raises his hand in to the air and yells: 'F*** the government and f*** Boris!'

Styles' father Des is a director of a finance company and has worked in the lending and banking sector for 30 years.

During the election, Labour was accused of planning to take a sledgehammer to the City with punitive taxed if they won power.

Mr Corbyn's flagship campaign message was also a blistering attack on the ultra-wealthy, who he pledged to come down hard on.

Last summer, Styles snapped up his Hampstead pad for £8.8million to add to his burgeoning property portfolio which also includes a Hollywood Hills mansion.

In 2018, he was ranked third on the Sunday Times young rich list, only beaten by Adele and Ed Sheeran.

When the song Vossi Bop was released by Stormzy in April this year, Mr Johnson was a backbencher having resigned from Theresa May's government over her Brexit withdrawal deal.

It is believed her failure to ram this deal through the Commons was the origin of the lyric, with Stormzy also opting to take a swipe at leading Brexiteer Mr Johnson.

During this Christmas' election campaign, the rapper joined a slew of celebrities in urging supporters to vote Labour - before the party crashed and burned at the polls, taking its worst drubbing in 80 years.

This haul of Corbynista stars - including Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall - fuelled accusations millionaire celebrity class are wildly out of touch with ordinary voters.

Indeed, the Prime Minister won his thumping majority by mopping up votes in working-class heartlands.

Stormzy memorably chanted 'oh Jeremy Corbyn' at Glastonbury and at the Brit Awards used a song to savage Prime Minister Theresa May.

After his would-be PM suffered humiliation at the ballot box last Thursday, the rapper went into a classroom and told young boys and girls 'Boris is a bad bad man'.

This sparked fury online, led by GMB presenter Piers Morgan who said: 'He shouldn't have done this, and shouldn't have been allowed to do this.'

The bemused rapper hit back, writing: 'The kid asked me a question and I replied truthfully nothing wrong with that Piers lol.'

This prompted another response from Piers: 'Come off it @stormzy - saying stuff like that to a bunch of very young schoolkids isn't cool, and you know it. You're a hugely influential role model now to so many youngsters, wield that power more carefully.'

But the rapper refused to back down, telling the TV host: 'No it isn't cool, it's the truth lol. Again, they asked me a question and I answered it truthfully and with jest. I gave em my opinion, they'll grow up and be able to make their own, this ain't a shocking incident pal sorry lol.'
