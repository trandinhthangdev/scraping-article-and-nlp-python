A Melbourne man is set to face court accused of deliberately setting grassfires in the city's northern suburbs.

The 47-year-old was arrested on Saturday morning over three blazes in Craigieburn and Roxburgh Park in the early hours, as well as a series of fires dating back to October.

Police say fire crews extinguished the blazes before they could damage properties.

He's expected to face the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday on 11 charges, including intentionally causing a bushfire and criminal damage by fire.
