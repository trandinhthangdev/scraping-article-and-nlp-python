With his honeymoon on hold, Anthony Quayle is making the most of the delay as he attempts to win an Australian PGA Championship seven days after getting married.

The Gold Coast product moved to eight-under and a shot back from shock overnight leader Yuan Yechun thanks to five birdies in the last six holes in a Friday round of 66 at Royal Pines.

Married at nearby local club Sanctuary Cove last Sunday, the Quayle honeymoon won't officially start until they jet to Europe on Boxing Day.

But he said he's treated the tournament like a holiday anyway, with surprising results.

"Any opportunity like this, you just enjoy it and have a little bit of fun," he said.

"Obviously getting married on Sunday, this week is a little bit of a holiday for me.

"I plan to keep it that way, just keep having a little bit of fun with it."

Starting on the 10th tee, Quayle got going with an eagle on 15 but said the moment of his round came on two holes earlier when an eight-metre putt saved par despite him finding water off the tee.

He credits his resilience for a testing season in Japan, which started slowly but finished with him qualifying for the tour's year-end championship.

"I don't want to ever shy away from how I struggled earlier this year," he said.

"That is part of why I am who I am ... I just think going through that has made me a lot tougher at the moment mentally."
