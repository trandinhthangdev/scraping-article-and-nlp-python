Running back Frank Gore Jr., who announced in June that he would play college football at Florida Atlantic, flipped his commitment Thursday to sign a national letter of intent with Southern Miss.

The son of Buffalo Bills running back Frank Gore played at Miami Killian Senior High School, and he was ranked as a three-star prospect and the No. 65 running back and No. 129 Florida high school prospect on the 247Sports composite.

According to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Gore made an official visit to Southern Miss in Hattiesburg on Dec. 6, the day before FAU head coach Lane Kiffin announced he was leaving to become head coach at Ole Miss.

As a senior at Miami Killian, Gore gained 1,111 rushing yards on 113 carries with 13 touchdowns.

Gore's father, who was a college running back at Miami (2001-04), continues to play with the Buffalo Bills. He has 573 rushing yards on 160 carries this season, his 15th in the NFL.

Now 36, the elder Gore is a five-time Pro Bowl selection who played 10 seasons for the San Francisco 49ers after starting his pro career there in 2005. He also was a member of the Indianapolis Colts (2015-17) and the Miami Dolphins (2018).

He ranks third among the NFL's all-time leading rushers with 15,321 yards, trailing only Emmitt Smith (18,355) and Walter Payton (16,726).
