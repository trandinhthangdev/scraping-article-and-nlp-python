Police got to the home of the St. Petersburg, Florida native at about 8 p.m. PST, and did not initially receive a response.

When they entered, they found the singer asleep in his bedroom, according to the outlet.

Aaron told TMZ first responders had asked him if he was suicidal, had taken any pills or threatened to harm himself but he insisted that wasn't the case.

He also plans to ask police to foot the bill to fix his door after they broke it down to get to him.

Costly: Carter on his livestream showed off the damage to his door as result of the incident

The music producer and DJ eventually got back on his livestream, where he showed off the damage done when the police busted through his door and complained that he had been 'swatted.'

The term that refers to a dangerous prank where people send police and emergency services to a target's house. (Other celebs who've been the victim of similar pranks include Justin Bieber and Simon Cowell).

The Sooner or Later singer was irate at the damage done to his door as result of police entering the abode, and was back on his livestream to complain.

He told viewers: 'I don't know who called but y'all need to chill out ... the f***ing cops broke, in my f***ing door - it's f***ed.'

Irate: Carter sparred with some in the livestream chat in the wake of the incident, saying, 'F*** you and the horse you rode in on'

Carter sparred with some people in the chat room who said he was blaming the incident on others rather than taking responsibility for it after he dozed off during a previous stream.

'F*** you and the horse you rode in on - f***ing s**k it,' the singer said as he snacked on a piece of string cheese.

Carter, who said he's already contacted a locksmith to fix the broken door, was visited by a concerned neighbor who helped to fix the door.

At one point, he even appeared to the the subject of another prank when a man pulled up to the house saying he'd seen an ad on Craigslist with the address.

Things seemed to calm down at the Carter residence as his neighbor went to gather supplies for a temporary fix of the door, and he chatted on the phone with a pal about the hectic evening while the stream remained running.

'I'm fine, I'm chill - I got some pizza coming, so I'm just chilling,' he said, later retrieving a broom to sweep up debris that had gathered by the door.

MailOnline has contacted Aaron's representatives for comment.

The latest incident comes during a turbulent time for the former child star.

Last month Carter was ordered by a judge to give up his guns in regards to an open case where his twin sister Angel was granted a one-year domestic violence restraining order, which will expire on Nov. 19, 2020.

TMZ claimed Carter began to 'scream' at the judge, threatened to leave the proceeding and declared he would just go out of state and buy more firepower.

Later in the afternoon, the Candy singer took to his Instagram Story and maintained that he would in fact, 'abide by the judge's order.'

A judge in Nevada granted his brother Nick Carter, 39, a one year restraining order against Aaron during a Wednesday hearing in Las Vegas.

Under the order, Aaron is prohibited from contacting his Backstreet Boys brother for one year.

Aaron also accused Nick of sexually assaulting women — Nick has denied all claims — after Aaron previously backtracked on these allegations in October.

Angel initially filed the order against her twin brother in September, claiming he told her he had violent thoughts 'toward babies and family members,' and the family later called police to his home to remove firearms as they 'feared for their safety.'

Carter shared a photo from the hospital in Florida last month where TMZ claimed his mother Jane was alarmed by how much weight her son had recently lost.

He also recently claimed that he bought a castle in Novia Scotia and is looking forward to 'changing his whole lifestyle' with a move to Canada.
