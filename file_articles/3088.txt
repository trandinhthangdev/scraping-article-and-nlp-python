Western Sydney Wanderers haven't won an A-League game since October, and their proficiency with the boot is also drying up with just two goals in four games.

After 10 games they are now averaging a goal a match - a stark contrast to the way they started the season, when they scored five goals in their first three games.

Coach Markus Babbel is under immense pressure to turn things around, with the Wanderers now seventh on the ladder and having gone six rounds without a win following Friday's 1-1 draw with Western United.

But reviving their attack will not be easy.

"The chances are there, so we have to take them," Babbel said.

"At the moment we are not ready for the moment.

"It's not easy to create many chances against a team who are playing 11 players 30 metres in front of the goal to find the space, this is not easy, but we had four or five really good chances and just couldn't score.

"We have players that can score but we have to work on that. Don't stop believing."

Babbel believes a mental blockage is now the problem with his attack rather than a tactical issue.

"It's definitely not a tactical problem," he said.

"In the beginning we were nearly 100 per cent taking our goal chances. It was unbelievable.

"Every opportunity that was there we scored and now it's different.

"This is football. You have periods where you're sure of a goal and then periods when you need many, many chances to score a goal. This is football.

"We have to work on our technique and make sure the boys are in the right position and it will come."
