She was the picture of sophistication as she performed Truth Hurts and Good As Hell in uncharacteristically demure numbers on Saturday Night Live earlier in the evening.

And Lizzo kept the good times rolling as she attended the show's star-studded afterparty in New York City on Saturday.

The chart-topping singer, 31, ensured all eyes were on her as she sizzled in an off-shoulder neon green dress, complete with balloon-inspired sleeves.

In her true head-turning fashion, the songstress flashed her glossy red pedicure in a pair of pointed feathered heels.

The musician upped the style ante as she toted her belongings in a purple chain-strap handbag, and accessorised with classic hooped earrings.

With her tresses styled into tight curls, the media personality complemented her radiant complexion with a heavy coating of foundation, false lashes and dewy red lipstick.

The show marked the final episode of Saturday Night Live for this year and decade, and more importantly, the show welcomed back one of its most beloved alumni — the great Eddie Murphy.

The comedian, 58 - was a regular cast member on Saturday Night Live from 1980 until 1984 - was in rare form on Saturday's show — most notable was when he 'crashed' the Weekend Update segment as the loudmouthed, brash Gumby and all but refused to leave.

At the top of the program, Eddie got right down to resurrecting some of his favorite skits of yore, which started with Mister Robinson's Neighborhood — all the timelier since Mister Rogers has been in the spotlight thanks to both a recent well-received documentary and the new feature film starring Tom Hanks.

In the Robinson's skit, he mentioned how a lot has happened since last audiences spent time with him — namely, gentrification.

He also talked about other new trends that have cropped up, including 23 and Me, which he identified as '23 people say, "My father is me!"'

Another fun and cheeky moment came when Eddie and the cast appeared in a pre-recorded and rather ironic Christmas greeting from SNL to viewers, which showed a loving family gathered around a warm holiday table, with the father (Murphy) making a heartfelt toast.

Interspersed within his speech were flashbacks to earlier in the weekend, showing various family members (including Kenan Thompson and guest performer Maya Rudolph) driving each other absolutely crazy as often happens when families unite for the holidays.

The skit closed with a title card wishing viewers a happy holiday from SNL, saying 'To all out families: we love you even when we don't.'

Another retro moment was when the Coming To America star reprised his role of Buckwheat, a bonkers take on the Little Rascals character, who now found himself a contestant on The Masked Singer.

Balancing out the mayhem was the glorious Lizzo, who stunned in a Gucci trench coat dress for her first set.

The hitmaker's second performance was a chill and jazzy rendition of her hit Good As Hell, accompained with pole dancers.
