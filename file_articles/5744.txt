Peak-hour commuters were stunned when two men in Perth got into a brutal road rage fight in the middle of a traffic jam on Wednesday evening (pictured)

The man in high-visibility appears to try and defend himself as the other man pummels him with punches until he tumbles to the ground.

Talia Sadak, who works on the road and witnessed the incident, told Seven News the fight stopped peak-hour traffic.

'They stopped all the traffic, people were trying to get through, beeping their horns and everything, it was just so full-on,' she said.

'The other guy that was in the blue car jumps out straight away and without saying anything started punching into him.'

She said the incident only lasted moments before both men went back to their own cars and drove away.
