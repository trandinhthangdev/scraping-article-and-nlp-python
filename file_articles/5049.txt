Gareth Southgate has insisted that every team has their falling-outs after reflecting on Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez's shocking bust-up in November.

Sportsmail broke the news that the two England team-mates had clashed in the canteen at St George's Park, which left Gomez with a large scar that stretched from his cheek down to his neck.

Now, as he reflects on another successful year as England boss, Southgate claims that no team is perfect and his Three Lions squad reacted in the right way.

'No journey of a team is ever going to be smooth and seamless,' Southgate told the FA.

'I think those moments of difficulty are really where you find out about people and really you then have a chance as a group to react in one way or another.

'You can either fold and things can fall apart a bit, or you can react in the right way.

'Some of those challenges in Montenegro and Bulgaria were broader than just football and we knew there was an opportunity to perhaps make a difference in wider society.

'But also, they were an important moment for us as a team, that everybody felt supported and everybody felt the team were united in what they were going to do. We definitely got to that stage as the year went through.'

While England experienced heartbreak in the inaugural UEFA Nations League Finals back in June, Southgate believes the tournament can be seen as a positive ahead of next summer's Euros.

England discovered they will be facing Croatia and Czech Republic in their group at the tournament while Scotland could find themselves as the fourth team should they pass the qualifiers.
