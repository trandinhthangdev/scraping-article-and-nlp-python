Victorian police officers have pulled the pin on industrial action after reaching a pay deal with the state government.

The government says the deal, reached after six months of negotiations, is for a two per cent annual pay rise.

The Police Association Victoria says the offer is closer to three per cent, after taking into account extras such as increased penalty rates on weeknights and two extra weeks of paid parental leave.

"It's a deal that we think is fit to take to our members for their consideration," union secretary Wayne Gatt told reporters on Friday.

"When you combine the total salary outcomes for our members, it will be about three per cent for our members.

"We see this as a win for our members."

Industrial action that began on Monday, with slogans written across police vehicles calling for a fairer deal, has been suspended pending a vote by 17,200 union members.

Police Minister Lisa Neville said the agreement fell within the government's two per cent wages policy, despite the extra perks on the table.

"This is now a matter for the Police Association to put out to its members, but I think they will see this is a fair deal, and one that rewards them - gives them improved wages but also enhanced conditions," she said.

"I think they feel very confident that this is a deal that does actually back in what the police and their log of claims are. This agreement delivers."

Ms Neville said some aspects of the deal that were promised during the last election fell outside the government's wages policy and amounted to about $100 million.

That included an $8000 to $10,000 salary increase for sergeants and senior sergeants will be phased in over four years.

An extra 90,000 extra shifts will be added through officers returning from work-related injuries, while a structured career path for protective service officers will be rolled out.

The current enterprise bargaining agreement expired at the end of November.
