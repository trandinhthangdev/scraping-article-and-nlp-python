What does it do?

Run by Aberdeen Standard Investments, the Murray International Trust invests around the world.

It aims to give its investors an above-average dividend relative to the share price.

What does the manager invest in?

The manager seeks out companies which it thinks are undervalued by the market and have the potential to perform well.

Biggest holdings include chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor and Mexican airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario.

What do the experts like?

Dzmitry Lipski, an investment analyst at Interactive Investor, says manager Bruce Stout 'sticks to his strategy without taking on excessive levels of risk'.

He adds: 'Unlike its peers, the trust has almost half of the portfolio invested in Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, Latin America and other emerging markets, as this is where the manager finds the best opportunities.'

Any downsides?

Lipski adds the trust may not be for everyone, as the fund manager doesn't follow the crowd.

This means it may underperform when the manager's style is out of favour, even if the wider market is having a good run.
