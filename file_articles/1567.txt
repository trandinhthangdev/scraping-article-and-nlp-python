'I always put one together so I'm not running around on Christmas morning trying to find scissors or batteries!

'Mine has batteries, scissors, mini screwdrivers and bin bags.'

The woman's post was quickly met with hundreds of comments, with many saying they'd never thought to get everything ready beforehand.

'This is such a great idea, I'll be making one today,' one woman posted.

'Best idea ever. I've spent the past three Christmases scrounging for batteries,' another added.

Some said they also have a Christmas morning box, and include the likes of permanent markers to label things as well as pen knives and string.

'The Christmas morning box is stocked and ready to go,' one woman posted alongside a snap of her own Christmas morning box.

Many said it's worth having batteries in all sorts of varieties including the most popular AA and AAA for Christmas toys.
