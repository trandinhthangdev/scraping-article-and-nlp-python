An assessment of agricultural losses from the Adelaide Hills and other bushfires across South Australia is underway.

But Primary Industries and Regions SA says it will take time for the full picture to emerge as some of the fires are still burning.

State controller Mehdi Doroudi says work has begun on the Cudlee Creek fireground, in the Hills, and on Kangaroos Island, the scene of the worst devastation.

"At this stage, we are still verifying reports of livestock, horticultural, viticulture and other relevant agricultural losses," he said.

"Given the number of fires and the fact that Cudlee Creek and the Kangaroo Island fires at Menzies and Duncan are still active it will take some time."

Mr Doroudi said officers were also working with teams from the RSPCA and other organisations as part of the livestock assessments.

A 24-hour hotline number - 1800 255 556 - has been activated for primary producers and animal owners seeking urgent assistance and information.

Help is also available for checks with injured livestock including horses and for the provision of fodder.
