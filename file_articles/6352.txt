Queenslanders will struggle through high temperatures for the rest of the week as a heatwave engulfs the state.

The Bureau of Meteorology says high temperatures which are being felt in the west could move towards the coast by the weekend.

The worst of the heat is expected to hit the coast on Sunday with temperatures about 10-12C above average, said Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Kimba Wong.

She said this could mean more maximum temperature records could be broken across the state.

Brisbane recorded it hottest December temperature on Monday, peaking at 41.2C.

The small town of Urandangi, on the Queensland-Northern Territory border, broke its all time record on Wednesday when the bureau recorded a maximum of 47.5C

In the state's north west, the town of Julia Creek has reached a top of at least 42C over the past fortnight.

Temperatures in the 40s are expected to continue well into next week in western parts of the state.

Birdsville and Bedourie are forecast to be the hottest towns in Queensland on Christmas Day with 47C expected.

It will be a cooler Christmas for the coast, with temperatures in the south east to be in the low 30s.

There is a chance of showers for the Gold Coast Hinterland, which could reach the coast.

Fire fighters who are battling several blazes on the central coast of the state are expected to experience more favourable conditions next week.

"Fortunately along the coastal fringe we do have the sea breeze coming in bringing a touch moisture and slightly more moderated temperatures," Ms Wong said.
