'They are not used to losing. It was a good day for me. I know how Everton supporters want to be at Liverpool.

Ancelotti has also teased that he might give Zlatan Ibrahimovic a call to see if the striker wants to come to Everton.

He said: 'He is a good friend of mine and fortunately I have trained a lot of fantastic players.

'I think he finished his period in the United States and really I don't know what his idea is.

'I am going to call him, if he wants to come to Liverpool to enjoy, he can come. But not to play, not to play!'
