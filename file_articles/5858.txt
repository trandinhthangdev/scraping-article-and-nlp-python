Oxford United may have been knocked out of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night but they did come away from the Kassam Stadium with a rare feat.

Karl Robinson's side recorded 18 shots during the League Cup match which is the most a Pep Guardiola Manchester City side has ever faced.

The League One outfit peppered Claudio Bravo's goal as they searched for a quarter-final upset against the Premier League champions.

MOST SHOTS FACED UNDER PEP GUARDIOLA AT CITY 18/12/2019: Oxford United (League Cup - 18) 04/08/2019: Liverpool (Community Shield - 17) 06/12/2016: Celtic (Champions League - 16) 14/01/2018: Liverpool (Premier League - 16) 20/09/2017: West Brom (League Cup - 15) 21/02/2017: Monaco (Champions League - 15)

City's title rivals Liverpool previously had the feat as they took 17 shots during this summer's Community Shield at Wembley, which Guardiola's men won on penalties after a 1-1 draw.

Oxford managed to cancel out Joao Cancelo's opener in the 46th minute when attacker Matt Taylor netted just after the break.

Raheem Sterling then netted a brace to ensure City progressed to the next round to set up a two-legged semi-final with Manchester United.

U's boss Robinson joked: 'I wouldn't call some of them shots. Three or four were crosses that were miskicked, but it is a great stat.

'It means nothing because the result is the result, but it is something we can build on.'

Celtic have had the most shots against Guardiola's City in the Champions League with 16 while Jurgen Klopp's attacking Liverpool side have had the most in the Premier League with 16 also.

West Brom and Monaco are surprisingly in the top six while there is no sign of Manchester United, Chelsea or Barcelona.

Wednesday night's game is likely to be Mikel Arteta's last as Manchester City assistant manager as the Spaniard is expected to become Arsenal manager on Thursday.
