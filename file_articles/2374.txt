The Houston Astros have traded for catcher Martin Maldonado in each of the previous two seasons.

Apparently, Houston is looking to keep him around this time, with the team reportedly agreeing to a two-year, $7 million deal with the journeyman on Friday.

The Chicago Cubs sent Maldonado, 33, to the Astros for utility man Tony Kemp on July 31.

Maldonado had already been traded from the Kansas City Royals to the Cubs just over two weeks prior.

The previous July, the Los Angeles Angels traded the catcher to the Astros, getting a minor leaguer and international pool money in return. He signed with the Royals as a free agent in March.

A career .219 hitter with 63 home runs across nine seasons with Milwaukee, the Angels, Astros, Royals and Cubs, Maldonado reportedly had other offers, but took less money to stay in Houston, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand.

Maldonado finished 2019 with a .213 batting average, 12 home runs and 46 runs scored.
