Kelly Bodsworth is being investigated

A prison boss is under investigation for allegedly paying off her imprisoned son's debts in jail.

Kelly Bodsworth, workforce development manager at Metropolitan Remand Centre, is being investigated for allegedly paying inmates while her son was jailed at Ravenhall Correctional Centre in Victoria.

The claims were contained in an intelligence report which was filed by the prison earlier this year, the Herald Sun reported.

The matter is now being investigated by Victoria's Anti-corruption Commission.

Ms Bodsworth apparently feared for her son's safety and is accused of making 'significant' payments to the inmates.

'They threatened if he didn't pay he was in trouble,' a source told the Herald Sun.

She was banned from visiting her son when the claims surfaced, but that has since been overturned, the publication reported.

A Department of Justice and Community Safety spokesman said prison staff must 'uphold the highest level of professionalism and ethics'.

'When they fail to meet those standards, they are investigated and face sanctions,' the spokesman said.

'The integrity of Victoria's corrections system is of the highest priority and matters are referred to external authorities when appropriate.'

There is no suggestion that the allegations are true, only that they are being investigated.
