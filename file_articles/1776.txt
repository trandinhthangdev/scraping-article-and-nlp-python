Mikel Arteta accepted the Arsenal job after Manchester City failed to assure him that he would be Pep Guardiola’s successor.

The 37-year-old Spaniard believed that as Guardiola's No.2 he would be the natural choice to take over if the manager's job became available at the Etihad Stadium.

Sportsmail reported that Guardiola had an option in his deal — which runs until the summer of 2021 — to depart at the end of this season.

But the Blues hierarchy were unable to offer any guarantees, despite reportedly making plans for Guardiola's possible departure, according to the Daily Mirror.

Director of Football Txiki Begiristain praised the contribution of Arteta after he accepted the Arsenal job.

He said: 'Mikel, as a member of Pep’s team, has contributed significantly to the Club in his time here in Manchester.

'His work on the training field and detailed preparations have helped us become a side that wins with regularity and in style.

'This move to Arsenal is a further step in his football development and I am sure he will become a top-class coach.'

Arteta watched from the stands on Saturday as Arsenal played out a dull 0-0 draw with former club Everton.
