Much needed rain will hit parts of Australia's east on Christmas Eve, but the mega-fire on the outskirts of Sydney will stay mostly dry.

The heaviest rain will fall in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland - with torrential downpours likely in Bundaberg and Rockhampton.

The area around Lismore in the north-east of NSW is set to receive around 50mm. The mean average for the month of December there is 129mm.

Areas further south will also see some rain but there will only be 5mm in Bilpin and Gospers Mountain, west of Sydney, where the mega-fire is raging.

There are fears more homes could be lost after the Grose Valley fire in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney flared up to emergency levels for the second time within 24 hours on Sunday.

The increased fire activity in Govetts Leap Road at Blackheath prompted officials to warn locals to seek shelter.

The Bureau of Meteorology predicted minimal rainfall around the country on Christmas Eve

Mr Morris also confirmed there would be no rain over South Australia throughout the Christmas period, with highs of 34 on Christmas Eve.
