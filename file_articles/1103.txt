MILAN, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Brescia striker Mario Balotelli replied to being dropped for the second time this season by coming off the bench to score on Sunday but his team had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Parma in Serie A after the home side snatched a late equaliser.

Brescia coach Eugenio Corini preferred Alfredo Donnarumma in attack in his starting line-up but he went off just past the hour with a muscle problem and was replaced by Balotelli.

The former Inter Milan, AC Milan and Manchester City forward made the most of his chance as he took advantage of poor marking to put Brescia ahead in the 72nd minute with his fourth goal of the season.

Brescia were on the brink of a win which would have taken them out of the relegation zone before Parma substitute Alberto Grassi headed the equaliser in the second minute of added time.

Brescia stayed 18th in the 20-team table with 14 points, one behind Sampdoria, while Parma are seventh with 25.

Bologna won 3-2 at Lecce in the other afternoon kickoff although they had to survive a late fightback by the hosts.

Riccardo Orsolini put Sinisa Mihajlovic's side ahead from close range two minutes before halftime, Roberto Soriano turned in the second after Rodrigo Palacio pulled the ball back in the 56th minute and Orsolini added another 10 minutes later.

Khouma Babacar volleyed one back with five minutes left and Diego Farias further reduced the arrears in stoppage time but it was too late for the hosts. (Writing by Brian Homewood Editing by Ian Chadband)
