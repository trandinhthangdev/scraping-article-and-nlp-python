A 15-year-old boy has been charged with lighting a fire in dried grass at Midvale in Perth's northeast in November.

Police have alleged the boy was walking along Morrison Road when he set fire to two areas of grass with fire crews attending to extinguish the blaze.

It's also alleged that he threw a baseball at a truck on the same day with the ball smashing the windscreen.

He has been charged with wilfully lighting a fire likely to injure or cause damage and with causing fear over the attack on the truck and will appear in Perth Children's Court on Saturday.
