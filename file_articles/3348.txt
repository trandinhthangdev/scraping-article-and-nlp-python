Motorola is pushing back the release date on its retro-style razr after unusually high demand.

According to the company, it's initial December 26th release date will now be pushed back to 'sometime in January.' It has yet to give a specific date on the launch as of time of publication.

'Since its announcement in November, the new Motorola razr has received unparalleled excitement and interest from consumers. Demand has been high, and as a result, has quickly outgrown supply predictions,' Motorola said in a statement.

'Motorola has decided to adjust razr’s presale and launch timing to better meet consumer demand. We are working to determine the appropriate quantity and schedule to ensure that more consumers have access to razr at launch.'

Motorola says it's pushing back the release date of its retro razr after customer demand exceeds expectations

The original Motorola Razr was a 'classic' design of the 2000's

Since the phone's unveiling in November, the reinvented razr has garnered significant attention from fans of its retro design which mimics the device's namesake from the early 2000's.

The device also mixes its throwback form factor with modern technology, including a 6.2 inch foldable screen that bends in half to shut in the same way as older 'clamshell' phones.

When closed, Motorola said the new razr also has a 2.7-inch Quick View Display on which users can view and respond to notifications.

While Motorola says it doesn't expect a significant delay, other folding devices of the razr's kin have befallen significant road bumps.

Samsung's Galaxy Fold - which folds open like a book - was released in September after months of delays relating to critical design flaws.

Huawei's Mate X also experienced multiple delays before it went on sale in China.

A number of other companies, including Chinese firms Xiaomi, have either already unveiled or are reported to be working on foldable phones.
