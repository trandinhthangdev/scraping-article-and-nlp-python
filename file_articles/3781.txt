A Leeds United-mad child had a Christmas visit to forget - and then one to remember - after Manchester United stars turned up to see him at a children's hospital.

The kid, called Eddie, whose dad posts on Twitter as @dfgase4gd4eg, was visited by United captain Ashley Young on December 10.

He was wearing a Leeds shirt and looked grumpy when Young showed up and had a simple response, when they were bearing gifts, according to his dad: 'Eughh, yuck'.

The tweet went viral and eventually reached the official Leeds United Twitter account.

And they decided to send one of their stars across the Pennines to cheer up Eddie, who is battling leukaemia.

On Thursday, his dad uploaded a series of pictures to his Twitter account that showed midfielder Adam Forshaw visiting him at his home.

Eddie posed with a brand new Leeds third shirt that Forshaw had brought for him along with a number of other gifts.

They include an official scarf, the official colouring book and a series of stickers plus a toy of the club mascot, Lucas the Kop Cat.

The caption to the tweet read: 'A big thank you to Leeds & Adam Forshaw for travelling to the dark side of the Pennines to cheer my lad up.

'Spoiled him rotten. Made our Christmas'.
