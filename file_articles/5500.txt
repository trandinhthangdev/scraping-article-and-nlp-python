Liverpool star Andy Robertson has expressed his delight at the club's signing of Red Bull Salzburg talent Takumi Minamino, describing his side's latest addition as a 'fantastic player'.

The Premier League leaders confirmed the signing of Minamino on Thursday morning for a measly £7.5million, after the Japanese international impressed Jurgen Klopp with his showings in the Champions League.

It is believed that the 24-year-old's performances for the Austrian side lead to Liverpool's star players imploring Klopp to secure a deal to bring the playmaker to Anfield.

The defender said Minamino was 'the main man' during tight encounters with RB Salzburg

And Robertson explained that Minamino's showing against Liverpool in their 4-3 win in October was the catalyst for the move.

'It was difficult to play against Salzburg full stop, but I thought he was their main man,' Robertson told the Liverpool Echo.

'He was the one, especially at Anfield, who caused us problems.

'When we went 3-0 up, he started to dictate the game. He started to run at us a wee bit and he got a goal and an assist.

'That might be why the gaffer started looking at him and thinking "who is this player?"'.

Minamino sealed his £7.5million move and will join the Premier League leaders next month

The Scot is excited for Minamino's arrival next month, where he will no doubt provide another key attacking option for Klopp as he looks to seal his club's first Premier League title triumph.

'In the two games we played against them, he was great. Other than that, I hadn't really seen him play,' he said.

'He will be a welcome addition for us and I'm sure he will be a fantastic player.

'We look forward to him coming over in January and I'm sure he'll add to the already high quality in this squad.'
