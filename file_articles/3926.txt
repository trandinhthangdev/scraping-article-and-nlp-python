Patrick Vieira is reportedly being lined up to become Inter Miami's head coach ahead of their debut season in MLS.

The ambitious David Beckham-owned franchise will face Los Angeles FC in their first-ever MLS fixture on March 1.

And according to ESPN, former New York City manager Vieira, now at Nice, is now the No 1 target to become their first-ever boss.

Inter Miami had made efforts to tempt Carlo Ancelotti to take charge of the team, with Beckham looking to take advantage of his close relationship with the Italian - having worked with him at AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain.

But despite being open to moving to Florida after being sacked by Napoli earlier this month, Everton appear to have won the race for Ancelotti over Beckham's side.

Arsenal legend Vieira is regarded to be a more obtainable target, however, thanks to his wealth of experience in MLS.
