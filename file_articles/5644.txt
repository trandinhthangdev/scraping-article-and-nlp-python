BERLIN, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Germany's state-owned rail operator Deutsche Bahn wants to avoid one-off write-downs and a loss by selling 150 of its locomotives and 5,000 freight rail cars in a sale and leaseback deal, company documents seen by Reuters showed on Thursday.

The sale is expected to generate proceeds of 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), according to the documents.

Under the plan, Deutsche Bahn's freight division will lease all of its locomotives and rail cars from 2029 onwards.

A company spokeswoman declined to comment on internal documents.
