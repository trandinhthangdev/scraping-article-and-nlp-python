Shoppers are complaining that Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's have 'ruined Christmas' by delivering their festive orders without their turkeys.

Customers raged on social media after supermarkets told them that the birds were out of stock. Others didn't even get sprouts or stuffing when their orders arrived.

Complaints are sparking fears that supermarkets are running out of key festive ingredients.

Nikki Hill wrote on Twitter: 'My Christmas food delivery is on its way — thanks Asda for not having my turkey, sprouts and goose fat. Absolutely unbelievable that you don't have enough turkey and sprouts!'

Mother-of-four Rhian Lally, from Coulsdon, South London, booked her Asda delivery slot weeks ago.

The 49-year-old told The Sun: 'Two of my sons took in the shopping. When I got back I said 'Come on lads, where's the turkey?' They said: 'What turkey?' I said, 'Yeah yeah, where's the turkey?' But then I realised they weren't joking.'

Asda delivered a frozen turkey after she complained to the supermarket, but Tesco and Sainsbury's shoppers are reporting similar issues.

Amy Griffith said: 'Tesco left my turkey out of my click and collect! Only noticed when get home and unpack! Why are you trying to ruin Christmas?!'

A spokesperson for Asda said: 'Customers can rest assured our colleagues are working incredibly hard to make sure everyone receives their correct orders as soon as possible.'

A Tesco Spokesperson said: 'Our availability and service levels are really strong this week and we continue to do our best to make sure our customers have a great Christmas. We have plenty of festive products in stock to ensure everyone gets what they ordered.

'At the weekend, a very small number of customers had problems with their orders. We have been in touch with the customers to put this right.'
