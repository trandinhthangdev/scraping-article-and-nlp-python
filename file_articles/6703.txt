Dec 19 (Reuters) - Gold prices inched up on Thursday after the U.S. House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump on articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. FUNDAMENTALS * Spot gold was up 0.1% at $1,477.15 per ounce, as of 0152 GMT. U.S. gold futures were up 0.2% at $1,481.30 per ounce. * Trump became the third U.S. president to be impeached as the House formally charged him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in a historic step that will inflame partisan tensions across a deeply divided America. * The House action sets the stage for a trial next month in the Republican-controlled Senate on whether to convict him and remove him from office. * The dollar eased against a basket of currencies, making gold cheaper for holders of other currencies. * Two U.S. central bankers on Wednesday said the U.S. economy is in good shape after three interest-rate cuts this year, underscoring the consensus at the Federal Reserve for keeping borrowing costs where they are for the time being. * Prior to the impeachment vote, Asian shares edged higher on positive global growth outlook followed by improving economic indicators. * Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust , rose 0.3% to 883.29 tonnes on Wednesday. * India, world's second-biggest gold consumer, has restricted imports of gold and silver in the powder and unwrought forms, the government said in a notification. * Elsewhere, palladium edged up 0.1% to $1,924.97 per ounce. The metal prices had hit an all-time peak of $1,998.43 on Tuesday. * Palladium prices are close to breaking above $2,000 an ounce for the first time, with a gaping supply deficit fuelling a remarkable run that has seen the autocatalyst metal more than quadruple in value since 2016. * Silver rose 0.2% to $17.03 per ounce, while platinum fell 0.2% to $933.34.
