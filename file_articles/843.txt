No one has been arrested.

Firefighters across Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia have been tackling bushfires across the states for weeks.

It is not clear whether the firefighters targeted in the robbery have been taking part in the effort to control the blazes, which have killed three people in the last week - including two Rural Fire Service volunteers.
