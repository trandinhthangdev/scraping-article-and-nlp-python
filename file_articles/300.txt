She's known for her dedicated fitness regimen.

And Victoria's Secret model Kelly Gale showed off the fruits of her labour, in two jaw-dropping photos shared to Instagram on Monday.

Posing against a white wall in a racy pink frock, the 24-year-old drew the eye to her endlessly long and lean legs.

The skimpy dress also showed off the brunette's ample cleavage and tiny waist.

In one photo, Kelly ran her left hand through her tresses and gazed out into the distance.

The Swedish-Australian star appeared to sport minimal makeup, allowing her natural beauty to shine through.

Kelly's fans commented underneath the post with the likes of 'legs for days' and 'gorgeous'.

The girlfriend of American-Swedish actor Joel Kinnaman, 40, works hard for her figure.

In an interview with V Magazine in December last year, Kelly said she consumes a diet of 'fresh, organic produce' including vegetables, nuts, seafood and raw vegan dark chocolate.

'[I consume] superfoods every day such as chlorella and spirulina, and if I ever need an immune booster I have tons of ginger, turmeric and baobab,' she added.

Kelly said she's always led an active life and doesn't necessarily focus on just going to the gym.

'Usually on my days off, and sometimes before going to set, I end up heading to Pilates, boxing or jump rope.

'When that gets boring I go rock climbing with friends or find some other activity we can tackle.'
