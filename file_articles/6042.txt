Chris Wilder has confirmed midfielder Jack Rodwell is training with Sheffield United and admitted a January deal is possible.

Former Sunderland and Everton midfielder Rodwell has been without a club since leaving Blackburn Rovers upon the expiration of his contract in the summer, and has not played competitively since April.

The 28-year-old has been linked with a move to Italy, with both Parma and Roma previously interested, but Blades manager Wilder said a contract at Bramall Lane is not out of the question.

'We’re looking at him. He’s looking at us. It’s something that might develop,' Wilder said on Thursday.

'We’re looking at a couple of signings to help us after January.

'We need to be strong, have cover and some competition within the squad.'
