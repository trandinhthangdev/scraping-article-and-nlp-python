TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - Arizona has hired former Iowa State head coach Paul Rhoads as its defensive coordinator.

The school announced Rhoads' hiring on Friday.

He replaces Marcel Yates, who was fired with linebackers coach John Rushing on Oct. 30. Former NFL coach Chuck Cecil served as the Wildcats' interim defensive coordinator after Yates was fired.

Rhoads spent the past two seasons as UCLA's defensive backs coach after a two-year stint at Arkansas, where he was defensive coordinator in 2017. He also served as interim head coach after Bret Bielema was fired in November 2017.

Rhoads spent seven seasons as Iowa State's head coach, leading the Cyclones to three bowl games. He also worked as an assistant at Pittsburgh, University of Pacific and Ohio State.
