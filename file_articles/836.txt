This was Frank Lampard's biggest result since becoming Chelsea boss. He tactically outclassed his mentor in Jose Mourinho, but Frank will not want to make this win all about him.

He is not that sort of guy. He will want his players to get the credit.

Mourinho afterwards said Tottenham were beaten by the 'Antonio Conte system' but that's wrong. Conte didn't invent three at the back.

It was wrong for Mourinho to say that Lampard simply copied the 'Antonio Conte system'

Frank selected a system that Tottenham could not handle, and that's that. When I saw Mourinho's XI, what stood out to me was the midfield.

Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko started together and I did not think that would be enough to get control of the game. Mourinho had good players in Harry Winks and Tanguy Ndombele sitting on the bench.

The Portuguese tried to fix it at half time, bringing on Christian Eriksen for Dier. But Chelsea imposed their game on Tottenham throughout.

It was fast paced, the young players showed their quality, Willian put on a masterclass, N'Golo Kante did what he does in midfield and Spurs had no answer.

These were three valuable points for Chelsea after their slight dip in form. What Frank has to do now is make sure they put in performances like this against your Bournemouths and Evertons. Get those wins.

If you're a Chelsea fan, you have to be excited by what you saw on Sunday.
