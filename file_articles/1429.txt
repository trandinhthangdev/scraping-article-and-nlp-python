LaMelo Ball's father has advised his injured son and potential No.1 NBA draft pick to only resume playing with NBL cellar dwellers Illawarra once he's 100 per cent fit.

Ball has missed the Hawks' past four games with a foot injury and hasn't played since November 30.

It was initially expected he would be sidelined for four weeks and wouldn't return to the new year.

Ball is seeing a doctor each week and the Hawks hope they will get a clearer time frame on his return date at the end of this week .

Impressive Ball has averaged 17 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists in 31 minutes per game and his numbers increased after former NBA player Aaron Brooks suffered an injury and he took on additional responsibility.

There have been suggestions the 18-year-old won't play in the NBL again, but the league and Ball's father have suggested that won't be the case.

"I'm saying continue to play only if you're 100 per cent," Ball's father LaVar said on SBS television on Sunday.

'It's killing him right now not to play when the fans ask him.

"We have to think of his career and his longevity and be smart about things.

"Whether it be in two weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, whenever he's 100 per cent, come on back out again."

Ball senior denied it had been a risk for LaMelo to play in the NBL rather than get to the NBA by the more traditional route of attending an American college.

"It's never a risk if you know what you want to do,'' he said.

"I've taken him all over the world and he's seen different situations and this is a great situation."
