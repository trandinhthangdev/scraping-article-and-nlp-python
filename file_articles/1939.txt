If Bing Crosby visited Universal Studios Hollywood during the festive season he would be crooning about a green, not white, Christmas.

The cheeky Grinch holds court at the Los Angeles theme park along with a 17-metre twisting and turning Grinchmas tree, snow flurries and a Who-lebration featuring Dr Seuss characters.

Instead of photos with Santa Claus, park visitors line up for their Christmas snap with the Grinch who may - or may not - have termites in his smile.

Another green beast, Shrek, gets around the park in an ugly Christmas sweater along with plenty of other movie and TV creatures ranging from SpongeBob to Frankenstein's monster.

Harry Potter also gets into the Christmas spirit at Universal Studios Hollywood with Hogsmeade village decorated for the season, hot Butterbeer on tap, Hogwarts students performing festive songs with their giant frogs and collectible ornaments and fare available.

When night falls on Hogsmeade village the picturesque Hogwarts Castle, perched high above, comes alive with a dazzling light projection spectacular.

Grinchmas and Christmas in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter began November 28 and runs daily until December 29.
