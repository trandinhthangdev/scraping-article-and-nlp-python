Lucas Herbert's refined happy-go-lucky approach is working wonders on the Gold Coast as the emerging talent learns how to best combine work and play.

The Victorian was the clubhouse leader alongside Brett Rankin after his five-under 67 during the first round of the Australian PGA Championship on Thursday.

Herbert went birdie-birdie-eagle to begin his round in still conditions, before throwing in three bogeys in an eventful first nine holes.

He added four more birdies to be faultless after the turn and take advantage of the conditions before Royal Pines' traditional breeze picked up later on Thursday.

Herbert, usually one to plot a precise path through every round, said he was hardly aware of his score.

"I usually set little targets numbers-wise, but I really didn't today, just kind of just let everything go and just enjoyed being out there," he said.

"That was consuming my mind rather than the score."

It's a refreshing approach for a talent who admitted a season in Europe had taken its toll and thoughts of walking away altogether had crept in.

A barnstorming finish earned him a top-15 finish at the France Open to secure full European playing rights next season and importantly allowed the 24-year-old to return home early.

A hand ligament injury has healed well after impacting his Australian Open tilt, while he said he's learnt plenty on tour this year.

"You can't just be golf, golf, golf 24-7; you've actually got to concentrate when you need to and you've got to switch off when you need to," he said.

"That's probably the big takeaway for me.

"So I'll probably go shopping this afternoon or we'll go go-karting or something.

"It just keeps everything fresh, helps you enjoy the golf."
