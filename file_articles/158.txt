Noel Gallagher has hinted a 'reconciliation' with his estranged brother Liam might be on the cards after a decade of public feuding.

The Wandering Star singer, 52, has suggested he's willing to finally sort out his differences with his younger sibling, 47 - who has said he wants to make up with his brother for the sake of their mother, Peggy Gallagher.

However, Noel's hint at repairing his relationship with his former Oasis bandmate comes just days after Liam branded him a 'bully' in a Twitter rant.

In an interview with The Sunday Times, Noel said: 'Our family has never been close. I don’t know one person, one single person, in my life who is living in the perfect family. Not one.'

He then added: 'Reconciliation is a good thing.'

Former Oasis frontman Liam recently told a fan he could see him and Noel reuniting the Wonderwall group for Glastonbury 2021, after his brother takes a year off in 2020.

When one of his Twitter followers asked if they'd be getting the band back together for the Somerset festival, which celebrates its 50th anniversary next June, he suggested that it was a possibility.

He wrote: 'Too soon the little fella has threatened to take a year off which I highly recommend so I reckon he’ll give his head a good shake and bingo we’ll be on for the following year isn’t it.' [sic]

Liam also recently claimed the Some Might Say band's former guitarist - who quit Oasis in 2009 after a backstage bust-up with the Live Forever singer at their final concert in Paris - 'wants to meet up' with him and believes it's because he wants to 'beg' him to reunite Oasis.

The rocker responded to a fan who said the Manchester musicians will never get back together, with the star suggesting that his sibling could be preparing to 'apologise' to him and bury the hatchet once and for all.

Hopeful Liam replied: 'I've heard he wants to meet up wonder what he wants maybe he wants to apologise and beg me to let him start up oasis again thoughts anyone.' [sic]

Oasis bandmates: Speaking on Radio X with Zane Lowe, Noel couldn't contain himself when the DJ expressed his surprise at Liam's kind words about him during his last appearance

Noel's words come days after Liam branded him a 'bully' on Twitter after an explosive interview emerged of his estranged sibling saying their feud 'isn't f*****g' banter.

The former Oasis frontman and his ex bandmate Noel have been embroiled in a decade long feud since the iconic band went their separate ways in 2009.

Speaking on Radio X with Zane Lowe, High Flying Birds singer Noel couldn't contain himself when the DJ expressed his surprise at Liam's kind words about him during his last appearance.

Looking fuming, Noel responded: 'That doesn't mean s**t to me. Because he's on Twitter probably right now saying the exact opposite so it doesn't mean anything.'

'In here on camera, playing to the gallery, fine, good. But when it f*****g matters, he's abusing my wife and my kids.

Go let it out: The former Oasis frontman, 47, and his ex bandmate Noel, 52, have been embroiled in a decade long feud since the iconic band went their separate ways in 2009

'It's like no, no, no, you don't get to f*****g to do both. Either be a c*** and own it or don't be a c***. When I eventually see him, he'll realise it's not f*****g banter.'

The star had started the interview on a semi-pleasant note, discussing Liam's former band Beady Eye.

He said: 'When we were part of the same management I was saying, what's Beady Eye all about?

'It should just be him. He should have done that when the band split up. But for whatever reason they decided they were going to start another band

'He's the voice of the Oasis songs. Ever since the Supersonic documentary came out a new generation have discovered those songs.

Happier times: 'When I eventually see him, he'll realise it's not f*****g banter' Noel said (pictured 2008)

'He's out there performing the songs, he's got to make a living. It's all good.'

Liam didn't take kindly to Noel's comments on their feud, and took to Twitter on Friday to let rip at his brother.

Responding to a fan's post of the video, he typed: 'Noel Kevin Keegan Gallagher is the funniest thing I’ve seen or heard in over a decade the gift that keeps on giving.

'I’m scared I’m seriously upping my security so many people out there wanting to cause me harm HELP ME. There all BIG BULLYS.' (sic)

War of words: Liam didn't take kindly to Noel's comments on their feud, and took to Twitter on Friday to let rip at his brother

The spat came just days after Liam continued his bitter war of words with Noel by taking another disparaging swipe at his wife, little more than day after claiming the musician had attempted to close his Twitter account.

In another string of divisive tweets, posted on Tuesday, Liam took aim at Scottish publicist Sara MacDonald in response to Noel's criticism of his repeated attacks on social media.

Using Sara, 48, as an excuse to hit out at his older brother's perceived hypocrisy, he wrote: 'Your wife argues with oasis fans on social media mate she needs to grow up she's nearly 60 we all get s**t on social media my family gets it as well so don't be blaming me (sic).'

Liam also referenced Sara's own personal Twitter attack, in which she criticized his parenting skills, labelled him a 'deplorable w***er' and wished he 'dropped dead' before her kids were old enough to use social media.

Looking back in anger: In another string of divisive tweet, Liam, 47, took aim at Scottish publicist Sara MacDonald in response to Noel's criticism of his repeated social media attacks

He raged: 'She wished me dead wonder if theres a name for people who do that while you've got your dictionary out have a look (sic).'

The tweet prompted a mixed response from fans, with one writing: 'She also had a dig at you when you did Glastonbury. So what the f**k does Noel expect you to do. Stand by and let her insult you. If she plays with fire she must get burnt.'

Agreeing with the comment, Liam - who frequently responds to his followers on social media - replied: 'Thems the rules (sic).'

When asked if he'd received an apology from Sara for her comments, he added: 'No I didn't and it really upset me mam.'

The importance of being Sara: Noel recently claimed his younger brother is a "moron" for thinking he'll forgive him for repeatedly insulting his wife

Stop tweeting your heart out: Liam agreed with a fan who referenced her own criticism of the singer on social media, adding that he hadn't received an apology from the publicist

Wonderwail: LIam's tweets prompted a mixed response, with some fans agreeing with the singer and others criticizing him for continuing to perform Oasis tracks at his live shows

Whatever: Despite opening up his war of words with Noel, Liam still made the astonishing claim that an Oasis reunion is still on the cards

Evidently in agreement with Liam, another fan wrote: 'He needs to realise you've not wished people dead?! That's sick! They're both jealous! I reckon she fancied ya and is jel because she got stuck with the boring one.'

Commenting on that, Liam replied: 'Leave it out I'm outing.'

Others were less charitable, with a number of fans slamming Liam for continuing to sing Oasis songs at live shows despite repeatedly provoking his brother, who wrote the bulk of the band's back catalogue.

When asked how much he pays Noel in royalties for including Oasis tracks in his set-list, he wrote: 'He makes nish I sign no forms I can sing then till my little heart is content nothing you or him can do about it snowflake.'

Despite opening up his war of words with Noel, Liam still made the astonishing claim that an Oasis reunion is still on the cards, telling one hopeful fan: 'It's coming.'

Plenty to say: The outspoken singer is a regular user of the social media platform, using it to keep in touch with his fans and also fire off insults at his older brother

In a recent interview with The Big Issue magazine, Noel claimed that 'every tweet' Liam posts about him is 'another nail in the coffin' for an Oasis reunion.

The High Flying Birds star also claimed his younger sibling is a "moron" for thinking he'll forgive him for repeatedly insulting his wife Sara MacDonald and blaming her for being the reason the guitarist won't reform their band.

He said: 'It's strange behaviour for someone who is gagging for me to pick up the phone and say let's do it. He'd put his whole life on hold to get Oasis back together. But every tweet he sends out it's another nail in the coffin of that idea.'

Addressing his brother directly for his verbal attacks on Sara, Noel added: 'If you think for one minute I am going to share a stage with you after what you've said you are f***ing more of a moron than you look.'
