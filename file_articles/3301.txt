The women had an awkward exchange on social media this week in the midst of Denise's recent medical emergencies that seemed to hint that there was trouble.

Rinna appeared to take a swipe at her co-star in the comments section of a post where Denise explained that he had been hospitalized and pointedly mentioned that Denise had missed an event at Dorit Kemsley's house over the weekend.

In the caption of that very post, Denise revealed that she'd had a recent medical emergency that required her to have six hours of surgery.

In a Tuesday Instagram post, the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star shared candid snaps of her body after having four hernias removed 'a couple months ago'.

'I thought I had one femoral hernia, I actually had 2 femoral & 2 inguinal,' the 48-year-old captioned the post of herself lying in a hospital bed.

'And I waited way too long & didn't even tell my husband how bad I was feeling (I know it was stupid) ... gotta always listen to our bodies & take care of ourselves.'

Rinna bizarrely commented: 'Denise are you ok? You never showed up to Dorit's Sat night we were all so worried about you. What happened?!'

She continued: 'You said you were coming, you were meeting Garcelle, We never heard from you. What happened?'

In defense: Both fans and fellow housewives like Camille Grammer leaped to Denise's defense on social media after Lisa seemingly put her on blast for bailing on the event

One fan immediately leaped to Richards' defense in the comments section, replying to Lisa, 'she literally just posted what happened.'

The next day co-star Camille Grammer came to her defense and said: 'Denise did not quit #rhobh and Rinna you throw your friend under a bus. How about calling her to see how she's Doing and stop tweeting about it.'

Lisa passive aggressively snapped back: 'I did reach out to her privately. Thank you for your concern, Camille.'

Season 10 of Real Houseswives of Beverly Hills will return in 2020.
