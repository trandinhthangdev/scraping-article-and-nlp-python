Vice President Joe Biden leads in a new national survey as seven top Democrats gather in Los Angeles for a presidential debate.

Biden leads the field with 26 per cent support in a new CNN survey. Following close behind are Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Biden has consistently held a lead in national polling, although it is down 7 points from a year ago, when it stood at 33 per cent.

South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 8 per cent, and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is now at 5 per cent, fueled by a multi-million self-funded spending spree.

All of those candidates but Bloomberg will be on the debate stage here in Los Angeles, joined by Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, billionaire Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang.

Buttigieg, who has been clashing with Warren over past work for corporate clients, leads in a new Iowa State University survey in the first caucus state. He is at 24 per cent, trailed by SAnders at 20 per cent and Biden at 15 per cent and Warren at 18 per cent.

Sanders is up from the same CNN poll a year ago, when he was at 15 per cent.

The field is not close to set. A bare 51 per cent majority said they were not yet settled on their selection. Half of Democrats surveyed said they were extremely enthusiastic about voting in 2020.

The poll was released a day after the House voted to impeach President Donald Trump, making him just the third president in U.S. history to face a Senate impeachment trial.

The number of Democrats who are very satisfied stands at 31 per cent, compared to 38 per cent in June.
