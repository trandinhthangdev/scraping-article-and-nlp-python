Pep Guardiola has revealed he will not replace Mikel Arteta this season as he will instead trust his team of coaches to replace the new Arsenal manager.

Arteta, who had been Manchester City's assistant manager over the last 18 months, finalised his move soon after Guardiola's press conference.

The 37-year-old had kept Guardiola informed of his movements over the last week, although City were disappointed at the way in which Arsenal have handled the appointment.

City will not appoint a new No 2 immediately, with Rodolfo Borrell set to take on extra responsibility in Arteta's absence. Guardiola is likely to look to make an appointment next summer.

Guardiola added: 'We'll stay with the same people that were here. We won't add anyone, we can do it with the people we have here.'

Arteta said farewell to City's squad on Thursday ahead of his unveiling at the Emirates Stadium.

'He's in London and close to finishing the deal with Arsenal. It's almost done,' Guardiola said before Arteta's move to the Gunners was confirmed. 'Yesterday and today he didn't train and he's going to Arsenal. I don't know the last details of the contract but it's there.

'He decided to move. You can't stop it, you have to follow your dreams. Arsenal was an important part of his career for him.

'They are one of the best teams in England. We wish him all the best and I'm pretty certain he'll do a good job.

'It is hard to sustain it. If you don't win, you can be sacked. Before it was just one camera and it was easier but it's changed a lot.'
