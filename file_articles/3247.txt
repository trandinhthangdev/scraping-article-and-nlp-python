The regulators have asked electronic trading firm Citadel Securities and at least one other firm for emails and other messages sent on the first day of trading, the Journal reported https://on.wsj.com/2Q4T5FL.

The SEC had also asked for information from Citadel on how it opened Slack's first day of trading, the report said.
