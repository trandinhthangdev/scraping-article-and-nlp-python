Dec 19 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept monetary settings steady on Thursday and maintained its upbeat view on the economy, suggesting policymakers are in no hurry to boost stimulus even as global risks threaten a fragile recovery.

The central bank, however, offered a gloomier view on factory output than at its previous rate review in October, a nod to the widening fallout from softening global demand and the U.S.-China trade war.

The decision to stand pat keeps Japan in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which have both signalled their respective monetary policies will be in a holding pattern for the time being.

Following are comments from BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda at his post-meeting news conference:

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK "Japan's economy continues to expand moderately, but inflation still hovers around 0.5%. Various risks cloud the outlook so we need to maintain our massive stimulus programme."

SINO-U.S. TARIFF WAR "It's welcome news that the United States and China held off on slapping additional tariffs. Markets are taking this positively. It's true that risk sentiment has improved. But there are still differences in views between the two countries, so we need to guard against risks." (Reporting by Leika Kihara, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)
