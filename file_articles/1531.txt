A secret collection of one of the world's oldest and rarest trees has likely been wiped out by an out-of-control 'megafire'.

There are fears roughly 250 Wollemi pine trees, also known as 'Jurassic trees', may have burned to the ground after a blaze ripped through Wollemi National Park.

The trees, which date back millions of years to the prehistoric period, live within a four kilometre square radius in the 501,000 hectare park northwest of Sydney.

But NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service confirmed on Saturday the Gospers Mountain fire tore through the park earlier this week, reported The Daily Telegraph.

WOLLEMI PINE TREES The Wollemi pine was discovered in what we now call Wollemi National Park 1994. Seedlings from the park were taken from the park and sold commercially. Some of the trees date back 400 years. Wollemi pines are listed as critically endangered.

The flames also ripped through fire retardant laid down to protect the trees.

Sprinklers were also set up to save the trees and a waterbombing helicopter was charged with the task of extinguishing spot fires.

When the blaze was 1km away, the chopper was called away to protect homes and the pines were left unprotected.

Pine plantations were destroyed in the fire, but wildlife services hope other plantations were spared.

Heavy smoke in the area has stopped officials from assessing the situation.

Environment Minister Matt Kean said the losing the trees would be a tragedy.

'Fires have swept through the region before, but the scale and intensity of these fires is unprecedented.'

The blaze covered 460,000 hectares from Gospers Mountain through to the Blue Mountains.
