A violent brawl in Sydney's west has left a teenager fighting for his life in hospital with serious knife wounds.

The 17-year-old has two collapsed lungs, a severed artery and a pierced liver after a knife was pulled on him outside the Meriton Apartments in Parramatta.

His horrific injuries were the result of a fight between six teenagers, including alleged associates of the 'Greater West' street gang, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The brawl allegedly kicked off after a conversation between two groups of teenage boys turned violent - with threats turning quickly to punches.

Police say a 16-year-old was knocked out cold when the first punch was thrown, before a knife was pulled.

The 17-year-old who was stabbed in the torso was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery, where he remains in a critical but stable condition.

A witness who was taking his family for dinner nearby said there was 'blood on the floor' and 'police all over the place in minutes'.

Police arrested five teenagers, aged between 16 and 19 years old, at least one of whom is allegedly connected to the 'Greater West' Gang.

A 19-year-old is facing five charges over the incident, including wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, custody of a knife in a public place and three counts of possessing a prohibited drug.

He was refused bail at Parramatta Court on Sunday, when he reportedly interrupted a magistrate to deny his involvement.

Meanwhile the two 16-year-olds charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and an 18-year-old charged with affray were released on bail.

Another 18-year-old was released without charge.
