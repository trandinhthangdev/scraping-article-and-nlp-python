A young Irish tourist has been charged with sexual assault after allegedly squeezing a female constable's bottom as she walked through a Sydney pub.

The man, 26, was partying at the Coogee Bay Hotel in the city's eastern suburbs when two officers arrived just after 11pm on Saturday.

As officers were making their rounds through the venue, police allege the man grabbed a female officer's bottom.

The man was being cautioned and removed from the premises when he allegedly squeezed the bottom of a senior male constable.
