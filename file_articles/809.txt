Phoebe and Sam Burgess

In October, it emerged that Phoebe, 30, and Sam Burgess, 31, had split for a second time, after previously breaking up in December last year and reconciling in April.

The Burgesses, who married in December 2015, share two children: two-year-old daughter Poppy and son Billy, one.

Sam was allegedly involved in an incident with his father-in-law at Phoebe's family home near Bowral, in the NSW Southern Highlands on October 19.

The sportsman had visited the property to spend time with his children when Phoebe was not present, but was asked to leave by Mr Hooke following an alleged altercation during which police were called.

At the time, police took out a temporary AVO on behalf of Mr Hooke, which was upheld by a court the following month.

While the AVO is in place, Sam is not able to go within one kilometre of his father-in-law nor any place he works.

Following the October 19 incident, Sam was also charged with intimidation. Sam has denied threatening the 63-year-old businessman.
