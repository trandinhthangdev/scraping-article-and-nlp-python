Migrants allowed to live and work in Australia if they invest at least $1.5 million could soon need to spend more money.

The Morrison government is looking at increasing the investment thresholds for business innovation and investment visas, and make changes to where the money must be spent.

Investors are currently required to spend at least $1.5 million up front, which must be held in the country for four years, while those accepted under the 'significant investor' stream must spend upwards of $5 million.

More than $13 million has been invested in Australia since the program began in 2012.

'Immigration to Australia is very attractive and we should be encouraging foreign nationals who want to come to Australia and invest in job creation,' Population Minister Alan Tudge said on Thursday.

'We need to ensure we are maximising the economic benefits from this program.'

Encouraging more investment in regional areas will be a key priority.

The government is also looking to 'streamline' the program, which currently includes three visas and nine visa streams.

Public consultation will be open until February 14.
