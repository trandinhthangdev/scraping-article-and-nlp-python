'Ferland [Mendy] was offside, just,' said Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane

Zinedine Zidane rued the hairline offside decision that cost Real Madrid victory against Barcelona.

Gareth Bale had the ball in the net midway through the second half but VAR checked the decision and ruled that the linesman had correctly flagged for offside against Ferland Mendy who had supplied the cross.

Zidane was asked about Bale's contribution and his 'almost' goal.

'Ferland [Mendy] was offside, just,' said Zidane, indicating the distance between forefinger and thumb.

'I would have liked him to have scored that. I was happy with his performance and he has to continue in that way.'

The Madrid coach was happy with his team's display. He added: 'We played well from the first minute to the last but when you have chances you have to take them.

'We played them in their half and we have to be satisfied with a point.

'We have scored a lot of goals this season but tonight it was not to be.

'The players should be happy with the way they have played.'
