Gianluigi Buffon insisted he would be doing himself a disservice if he stopped playing after he set another record on Wednesday.

The 41-year-old goalkeeper made his eighth appearance of the season in Juve's 2-1 victory against Sampdoria on Wednesday, and in doing so tied Paolo Maldini's all-time Serie A appearance record of 647 matches.

Buffon left Juve for PSG in 2018 but returned in the summer, and admits he currently feels nowhere near retirement.

'I know that I can still give myself many beautiful emotions, together with my team-mates,' Buffon told Sky Sports Italia.

'There are still many moments to live, as long as I am able to give the answers on the pitch.

'It's not a very important goal to play my 648th match in Serie A right now, but if I was to do it, I would like to do it with Juventus at the top of the table.

'I rely on my own honesty, letting life fulfil itself and show me the way. For how I am physically right now, I'd be doing myself a disservice if I stopped playing.'
