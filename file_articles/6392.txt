We found a young boy who had illegally entered the U.K. He was split up from his parents a few days ago, and doesn’t know which country they’re in.

“He was split up from his parents a few days ago, and doesn’t know which country they’re in,” the CMPG said in a statement.

“It’s impossible to imagine how scared someone would be, not knowing where they are, not knowing where their parents are, unable to speak the language.

“We’ve taken him to a place of safety with food and water until social services can come and take him to care.”
