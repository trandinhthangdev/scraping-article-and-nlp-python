Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is a target for Burnley.

The 19-year-old underwent minor heart surgery 18 months ago before bouncing back to become Chelsea's academy player of the year in May and has been impressing in the Championship this term while on loan with Charlton Athletic.

Burnley scouts have taken keen interest and manager Sean Dyche is eager to improve his midfield after the disappointing impact of Danny Drinkwater's loan from Chelsea.

Gallagher is a box to box midfielder with plenty of energy who has scored six goals while on loan and his departure would prove a big loss for Lee Bowyer's side.

It is understood Chelsea have an option to recall Gallagher who made an impact for England U21s too last month with a stunning goal against Albania.

Dyche, meanwhile, has also revived interest in Bristol City's 24-year-old midfielder Josh Brownhill and Derby County full-back Jayden Bogle, 19.
