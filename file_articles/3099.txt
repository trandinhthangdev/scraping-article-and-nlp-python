Method

Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan 160°C/gas 4. Grease and line a 900g loaf tin with baking paper.

To make the white nut mixture, melt the butter and oil in a large pan over a low-medium heat.

Add the onions and cook for 10-15 minutes, until they are soft and tender. Remove from the heat, then stir all the other ingredients in. Season and set aside.

To make the green stuffing mixture, simply blend all the ingredients together in a food processor, then season.

To assemble, put half the white mixture into the tin, then cover with the green stuffing mixture.

Spread the rest of the white mixture on top and press down lightly. Dot the surface of the loaf with vegan butter and top with a sheet of baking paper.

Bake for 45 minutes, then remove the paper and bake for a further 15 minutes, until golden brown.
