By Ross Kerber BOSTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields were steady on Thursday as traders weighed mixed economic signals on recent domestic labor market and business conditions against a largely encouraging macroeconomic picture. The benchmark 10-year yield was up less than a basis point at 1.9292% in morning trading, after rising as high as 1.9520% earlier. Yields fell back after the U.S. Labor Department said the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped from more than a two-year high last week. While the report pointed to sustained labor market strength, initial claims for state unemployment benefits were higher than economists had forecast. The figures drew traders' attention away from more positive long-term trends, said James Barnes, director of fixed income at Bryn Mawr Trust. "The recent attention on trade and global central policy shifted a little this morning" based on the jobs report, he said. In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business conditions index dropped to a reading of 0.3 in December from 10.4 in November. But there were increases in measures of new orders, unfilled orders, factory hours and shipments. Economic fundamentals look little changed, said Cantor Fitzgerald treasury analyst Justin Lederer, with technical factors likely driving many trades on Thursday. "Expectations for the economy are not as dire as they were a few months ago," he said. Earlier in the day German 10-year bond yields rose to six-month highs, as Sweden ended five years of negative interest rates - reinforcing a sense in markets that major central banks may be done with pushing borrowing costs further below zero. The two-year yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down less than a basis point at 1.6268% in morning trading.
