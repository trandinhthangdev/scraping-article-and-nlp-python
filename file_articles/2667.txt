Manchester City and Real Madrid 'have made contract with Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos after contract renewal talks stalled'.

The Brazil international's current deal at the Parc des Princes expires in June 2022 but negotiations to extend that by a further two years have faltered over his salary.

And, according to French outlet Le10Sport, City and Real are poised to take advantage of the impasse and try to sign the 25-year-old.

Talks between Paris Saint-Germain and their Brazilian defender Marquinhos have stalled

Manchester City and Real Madrid are reportedly interested in signing the PSG centre-half

Though naturally a central defender, Marquinhos has played regularly as a defensive midfielder for Thomas Tuchel's team this season.

Marquinhos joined PSG from Roma for €31.4million in the summer of 2013 and has since made 237 appearances for the Ligue 1 club.

City are seeking defensive reinforcements after a serious injury to Aymeric Laporte left them short-staffed at the back earlier this season.

Marquinhos would bring a wealth of experience of top level football to whoever signed him

Midfielder Fernandinho was forced to deputise at the back as reigning champions City lost ground to Liverpool in the Premier League title race.

With his extensive top level experience, including in the Champions League, Marquinhos would be a good fit for both City and Real.
