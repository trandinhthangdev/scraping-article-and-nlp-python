Dec 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were nearly flat on Thursday as investors looked past the impeachment of President Donald Trump, who is unlikely to be removed from office.

On Wednesday, Trump became the third U.S. president to be impeached, but the Republican-controlled Senate is widely expected not to convict him. No U.S. president has been removed from office in the country's 243-year history.

The S&P 500 snapped a record-setting rally on Wednesday, after closing at all-time highs every day for four straight sessions on a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks and hopes for a smoother Brexit.

Trading volumes are also expected to taper off ahead of the Christmas holidays.
