Zidane will face Guardiola for the first time in a competitive match in the Champions League

Real Madrid have been drawn against Manchester City in the last-16 of the Champions League

Madrid were beaten 4-1 by City in a pre-season game in the US during the summer but Zidane is relishing their forthcoming meeting in a serious contest.

'It will be special to go up against him. I played against him lots of times,' Zidane said at his pre-match press conference.

'I respect him as a player and as a coach because I think he's the best coach in the world.

'He's proved that during his career and I'm looking forward to going up against him and facing his team.'

Zidane has won the Champions League three times as a manager and once as a player

Guardiola has won the Champions League but it is eight years since he last lifted trophy

The two sides were drawn together after Madrid finished in second place in Champions League Group A and City won Group C.

While Guardiola has the most impressive managerial resume, Zidane has won the Champions League on three occasions and the Spaniard just twice.

Guardiola's success in Europe came during his time in charge of Barcelona and he's been criticised for his failure to win the competition since.

The 47-year-old has enjoyed domestic dominance at both Bayern Munich and Manchester City but hasn't reached a final since 2011.

Guardiola's side reached the quarter-finals of last season's tournament but were stunned by Tottenham over two legs.
