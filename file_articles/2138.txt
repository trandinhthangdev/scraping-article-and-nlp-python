Extra financial support is being made available for those impacted by the devastating bushfires across South Australia.

Payments of $1000 for each adult and $400 for each child are now on the table for those worst-hit by the fires, particularly the large blaze in the Adelaide Hills.

Federal Natural Disaster and Emergency Management Minister David Littleproud said the payments would help to provide dignity for those who had suffered a heavy loss.

"This is for people whose home has been severely damaged or destroyed, who've been seriously injured or who've lost a family member," Mr Littleproud said.

Claims can be made from Monday.

At least 15 homes have been destroyed in the Adelaide Hills blaze but that figure is expected to rise.

There have also been other buildings an infrastructure destroyed and a heavy loss of crops and livestock.
