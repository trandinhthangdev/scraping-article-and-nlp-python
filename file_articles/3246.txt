Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott did not have an injury designation on the team's injury report on Friday despite being limited in practice all week.

Prescott participated in soft toss during Friday's practice as he works his way through a sprained right shoulder. Prescott told reporters Thursday that the expectation is for him to throw Saturday.

The 26-year-old, who has yet to miss a start in his four-year career, has maintained that he will play on Sunday (4:25 p.m. ET) as Dallas (7-7) visits the Philadelphia Eagles (7-7). The Cowboys, who posted a 37-10 victory over the Eagles on Oct. 20, can secure their second straight NFC East title with a win over the Eagles.

Prescott sustained his injury in the first quarter of Dallas' 44-21 victory over the Los Angeles Rams last Sunday.

He has completed 65.5 percent of his passes for a career-high 4,334 yards and a career-best 26 touchdowns in 14 games this season.

Left tackle Tyron Smith (eye) also does not have a designation.

Linebacker Joe Thomas (knee), cornerback C.J. Goodwin (thumb) and wide receiver Devin Smith (knee) were given questionable designations. Linebacker Leighton Vander Esch (neck) is the only player the Cowboys ruled out.
