Fashionistas are rushing to get their hands on a pair of $20 summer slides that are almost identical to designer sandals worth nearly $1,000.

The tan coloured slip-ons, from Australian budget fashion label Cotton On, bear more than a passing resemblance to the iconic Oran sandals by luxury French fashion house Hermès, which cost an eye-watering $970 in Australia.

Shoppers first spotted the trendy shoes on the Instagram feed of Sydney fashion blogger Tina Abeysekara - also known as Trash to Treasured - who shares affordable looks for under $150 with her legion of 95,000 followers.

Fans are praising the budget-friendly shoes for creating the flattering illusion of longer legs.

Tina styled the slides with a long-sleeved leopard print shirt and cream linen shorts, revealing the easiest way to make your legs appear longer is by wearing skin coloured shoes and high-waisted bottoms.

'I'll take all the leg-lengthening I can get,' one woman joked in the comments.

The shoes have also been seen on Adelaide street style star Charnie Reeves, who recently sported a black pair on Instagram.

Frugal fashion lovers can choose between tan, white and black versions of the sandals, which run in sizes 35-42.

The slides are available from Rubi and Cotton On stores nationwide, and online.
