Fifteen prisoners had to be evacuated from a section of a Perth prison after inmates set fires in two of the cells.

A small number of prisoners also damaged their cells during the incident on Friday.

The fires, which were quickly put out, are believed to be linked to two prisoners involved in an earlier rooftop incident at the prison. Two prisoners were treated for burns and smoke inhalation.

A small number of prisoners were moved to another prison. Correctives Services Commissioner Tony Hassall said at no time was the perimeter security of Hakea Prison compromised. He said the disturbance was contained to a small area of one unit in the prison.
