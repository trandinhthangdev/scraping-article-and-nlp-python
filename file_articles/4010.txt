Another photo shared with Femail shows Holly and Eddie dancing as newlyweds.

Writing in her blog post, Holly explained the date has long held a special place in her heart.

She wrote: 'It marks the moment that Dad hung from a helicopter, with Sam and I in white tuxedos, and my mum agreed to become Joan Branson!

'It wasn't exactly what you would call a traditional wedding but it was a day full of amazing memories and I'm so glad that my brother Sam and I got to be part of the fun.'

Holly explained the date has long held a special place in her heart and that she and Freddie had planned to tie the knot on 20 December 2011. However, when a fire swept Necker Island, destroying the wedding venue of the Great House, pictured, plans were thrown into disarray

The photo of the days shows Sir Richard and second wife Joan, 71, standing in their wedding finery with their two eldest children against the stunning backdrop of the family's Necker Island.

Holly continued: 'A couple of decades after Mum and Dad tied the knot - Freddie and I thought it would be special to get married on the same day and in the exact same spot, with all our family and friends joining the wonderful setting.

'However, a tropical storm that summer seemed to feel differently! Necker was hit by a terrifying lightning storm that destroyed the main house. I’ll never forget the terror of waking up to my cousin Jack shouting: “Fire! Get out!”.

'Thankfully, everyone did manage to get out unharmed. The house… not so much. A few weeks later, when the initial feeling of relief that everyone had survived began to subside, Freddie and I reallised that our idyllic wedding venue wasn't looking quite so picturesque.'

On their third wedding anniversary, the couple welcomed their twins, Etta and Artie. Pictured, the twins holding hands on a London Tube platform in a photo shared by Holly on Instagram

She added: 'The memory of the fire was still so raw and, looking at the smiling faces of many of those who had been in the house that night, made our wedding all the more meaningful.'

Three years later to the day, the couple welcomed their twins, Etta and Artie. They are also parents to daughter Lola, who turns one next week.

Speaking on the twins' early arrival, Holly wrote: 'I ended up having an emergency C-section, and on the 20 December (thanks to the amazing doctors and nurses at St Marys) we welcomed Etta an Artie to the world.

'They were tiny but healthy and we couldn’t have asked for a better anniversary present. My Mum and Dad felt the same!'
