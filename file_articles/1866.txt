The co-founder of investment supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown, invested £25million of his £3billion fortune in the Blue Whale Growth Fund, a backer of Silicon Valley technology firms.

Its holdings are up more than 40 per cent since its launch two years ago, swelling Hargreaves’ investment to around £35million.

The fund has 20,000 investors – of which 70 per cent are individuals using platforms such as Hargreaves Lansdown, where Peter Hargreaves is the largest shareholder with a 32 per cent stake.

The fund has beaten the sector average by 7.1 percentage points since January and its popularity has swelled the fund from £100 million in March to £223million today.

It invests in 30 stocks, 70 per cent in the US. Facebook, Microsoft, PayPal and Visa are in its top ten holdings.

Hargreaves, 73, stepped down from the board of Hargreaves Lansdown in 2015 and launched the Blue Whale fund in September 2017 to hold his family’s wealth in the long term.

British companies including Unilever and Diageo make up just 10.3 per cent of the fund’s holdings, but it could start investing more in UK stocks if Britain bounces back from Brexit uncertainty.

Peter Hargreaves donated £3.2million to the Leave.EU campaign and £1 million to the Tory Election campaign.
