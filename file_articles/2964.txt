Injured Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant is interested in joining the MLS' Philadelphia Union, although becoming a 6-foot-10 goal-scoring forward is not in the plans.

Durant met with the Union on Friday, according to The Athletic, with the meeting believed to be about the NBA All-Star's possibility of joining the team's ownership group.

"We entertained Thirty Five Ventures for a meeting with Union Ownership," a Union spokesperson said in a statement to mlssoccer.com, without specifying any details.

Thirty Five Ventures is Durant's investment company, with the 10-time NBA All-Star possibly looking into diversifying his investment portfolio.

Durant, 31, was traded to the Nets this past offseason but has yet to play for the team. He still recovering from an Achilles injury that occurred during last season's NBA Finals when he was a member of the Golden State Warriors.

According to The Athletic, Durant had a previous interest in joining the ownership group of D.C. United. Other NBA-MLS ties include Magic Johnson's involvement with the Los Angeles FC ownership group and James Harden's stake in the Houston Dynamo.
