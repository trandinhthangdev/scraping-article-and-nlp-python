Jurgen Klopp has admitted Trent Alexander-Arnold's rapid development at Liverpool has been a massive surprise.

Alexander-Arnold has become one of the main men for Klopp's formidable Liverpool squad, as well as an England international, after making his first-team debut back in October 2016.

The England right back also played a pivotal role in Liverpool's Champions League triumph last season, and has been one of the standout players in the Premier League so far this season for the leaders.

And Klopp, ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup final, has since admitted he wasn't sure whether Alexander-Arnold had the physical attributes to become a world-class player.

'I have known Trent Alexander-Arnold since he was 17 years old,' Klopp told the BBC.

'He was a big talent but we were not sure he could do it physically. Now he is a machine – so he is a big surprise.'

Klopp also revealed that his squad immediately set their sights on more trophies after lifting the Champions League in June.

'The conscious decision we made with the boys was, as Liverpool players, it was not about winning one thing. It is about winning and there is no limit,' he said.

'The moment we did it was important – but it did not give us a feeling it was done.

'We like to think we would meet up in 20 to 30 years, look back and mix up the years. Was it 2019 or 2020?

'So far, so good. We try to squeeze everything we can get from our time together. There is no pressure, it is just opportunity.'
