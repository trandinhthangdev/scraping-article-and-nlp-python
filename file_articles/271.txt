Arsenal youngster Bukayo Saka insists he is struggling to decide which international side to play for.

The 18-year-old was born in Ealing, London but has Nigerian parents so therefore can play for England or Nigeria.

Saka, who is currently playing at left-back for the Gunners, has represented the Three Lions at under-16, U17, U18 and U19 level.

'I am always thinking about it but I haven't made a decision yet,' Saka told BBC Sport.

'No-one has been in touch but when I make a decision you will find out.'

Saka has also praised Unai Emery for giving him his debut before the Spanish boss was sacked by Arsenal.

The youngster said: 'I have a lot of thanks to give him because he gave me so much confidence, he gave me my debut and he kept pushing me. I am grateful to him always.

'It's just something I have always dreamed of, coming up from the academy to the first team.'
