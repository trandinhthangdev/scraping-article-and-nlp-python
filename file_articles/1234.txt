Jonny Bairstow is auctioning a Test shirt signed by the England squad to raise money for Rob Burrow's battle with Motor Neurone Disease.

Bairstow is a personal friend of Burrow, who revealed his diagnosis this week, with the pair getting to know each other while Yorkshire and Leeds Rhinos shared facilities at Headingley.

A crowdfunding campaign has been set up to assist 37-year-old Burrow in his treatment, as well as providing support for his family.

Bairstow has done his bit to help despite being on tour in South Africa, arranging for his team-mates to sign the shirt and opened the memento for offers in an Instagram video.

'I just wanted to put a few words together after hearing the news about Rob. It's desperately disappointing and upsetting for me to have heard the news,' he said.

'It's something that's hit me pretty hard having watched him over a long period of time in Headingley.

'The determination and strength he's shown over a long career is testament to himself, his family and his friends.

'I know he's going to fight this battle with that exact same determination.'
