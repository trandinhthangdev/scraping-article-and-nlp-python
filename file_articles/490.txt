A senior Queensland Bandidos bikie has been charged over the shooting of a man in the face in a dispute over a debt.

Kenneth James Whittaker, 45, appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday charged with attempted murder.

He is also charged with dangerous conduct with a weapon.

Police allege that Whittaker and a 29-year-old man, who were both arrested on Sunday over the shooting, were senior members of the Bandidos outlaw motorcycle gang.

The 29-year-old will front Maryborough Magistrates Court on Monday charged with attempted murder.

The 37-year-old victim was shot in the face and shoulder on July 13 and required surgery at Redcliffe Hospital.

Police executed search warrants at two properties at Samsonvale and Caboolture, both north of Brisbane, on Sunday.

A large amount of Bandido paraphernalia, several handguns, a sawn off rifle, ammunition, false identifications and dangerous drugs were allegedly found, police said.

Police also seized a vehicle alleged to have been used in the shooting incident.

A 25-year-old man was served with a notice to appear after he was located with cannabis at the Caboolture address.

A 21-year-old Samsonvale woman has been charged with drug-related and weapons offences.

She is expected to appear in Pine Rivers Magistrates Court on February 3.
