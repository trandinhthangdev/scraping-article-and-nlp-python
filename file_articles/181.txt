They celebrated their one-year anniversary in August this year.

And Bachelorette couple Ali Oetjen, 33, and Taite Radley, 29, proved they're still going strong in a photo shared to Instagram on Monday.

The pair packed on the PDA as they relaxed on Noosa Main Beach, while showing off their gym-honed figures.
