Adama Traore expects to recover from a shoulder injury in time for Wolves' trip to Norwich on Saturday.

The winger - one of the Premier League's form players - sustained the damage towards the end of Tottenham's 2-1 win at Molineux last weekend and although he made it to the end of the game, he was in clear discomfort.

But Traore has eased fears he will miss the trip to Carrow Road and believes he will be ready to play.

Adama Traore is set to shake off a shoulder injury and feature for Wolves against Norwich

He will be a marked man once again, with Wolves growing increasingly concerned at his treatment by opponents following the games against Brighton and Tottenham.

Boss Nuno Espirito Santo said after the Spurs game, when Harry Kane, Toby Alderweireld and Eric Dier were booked for fouls on Traore, that the 23-year-old risked serious injury if he was not protected better by officials.

Peter Bankes will referee the game as Wolves look to bounce back from their first defeat in 10 games in all competitions.
