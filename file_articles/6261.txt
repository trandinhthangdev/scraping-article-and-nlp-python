Dec 19 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares fell on Thursday as investors booked profits from the recent rally, and as investors wait for fresh data on the state of global growth.

** The Hang Seng index closed down 83.72 points or 0.3% at 27,800.49. The benchmark has gained over 5.5% this month. ** The Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell 0.35% to 10,985.89.
