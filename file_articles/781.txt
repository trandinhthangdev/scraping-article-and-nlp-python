Jimmy Lake wasted no time putting his stamp on the Washington program by firing offensive coordinator Bush Hamdan and tight ends coach Jordan Paopao on Sunday, on his first official day as Huskies' head coach.

The moves come one day after the Huskies routed Boise State 38-7 in the Las Vegas Bowl in Chris Petersen's final game as coach.

Hamdan has been Washington's offensive coordinator the past two seasons while Lake was serving as defensive coordinator. Hamdan was also on the Huskies' staff in 2015-16 before leaving to be quarterbacks coach of the Atlanta Falcons for one year.

Paopao was Washington's tight ends coach for the last seven seasons after being a graduate assistant the previous two years.

"I've really enjoyed working alongside Bush and Jordan and appreciate their contributions to Husky football," Lake said in a statement. "These decisions are extremely difficult, but I believe it's in the best interest of our program to make these changes to align with the vision we have for our team moving forward. I wish them both nothing but the best."

Hamdan had a long association with Petersen, including when he was a player at Boise State in a career that ended in 2008. Lake served as an assistant coach at Boise State from 2012-13 and followed Petersen to Washington when the latter took the Huskies' job following the 2013 campaign.

The Huskies currently rank fifth in scoring offense (32 points per game) and ninth in total offense (391.2 yards per game) among Pac-12 teams.
