A nine-year-old boy has died in hospital after being found unconscious at a public swimming pool in regional NSW.

Police say the boy, who's believed to have suffered from a medical condition, was found slumped in the water near the side of the Griffith pool on Friday afternoon.

A parent pulled the boy from the pool and he was taken to Griffith Hospital, where he died on Sunday.

"Investigations into the circumstances surrounding the incident continue - however, the incident is not being treated as suspicious," a NSW Police statement said on Monday.
