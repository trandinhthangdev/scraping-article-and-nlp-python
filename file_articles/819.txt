New Mexico indefinitely suspended forward Carlton Bragg and point guard JJ Caldwell, both starters, the school announced in a statement on Sunday.

The announcement came hours before the Lobos' home game on Sunday afternoon against winless Houston Baptist (0-9).

"Carlton Bragg and JJ Caldwell will not participate in today's game versus Houston Baptist," the statement said. "They are being withheld from competition and team activity until further notice. The athletic department has received information that requires further review. In the meantime, there will be no additional comments from anyone at UNM until that process is complete."

The 6-foot-10 Bragg, a redshirt senior from Cleveland, transferred from Kansas and began his Lobos career in 2018-19. In 13 games this season, all starts, he is averaging 13.5 points and 10.8 rebounds per game. He is second on the team in scoring, and second in the Mountain West Conference in rebounds.

Caldwell, a redshirt junior from Houston, is averaging 5.8 points and 5.7 assists per game. He is the MWC leader in assists.
