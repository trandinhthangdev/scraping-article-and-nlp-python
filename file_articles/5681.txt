NEW YORK, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The Trump administration finalized U.S. biofuel blending requirements for 2020 on Thursday, leaving a key part of the rule unchanged from an earlier proposal that the corn lobby had criticized as inadequate to help struggling farmers.

The move is destined to anger biofuel industry officials and corn-state senators who had pushed hard for changes until the eleventh hour, potentially threatening President Donald Trump's support among farmers ahead of next year's election. (Reporting by Stephanie Kelly Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
