Liverpool were handed a huge boost after Virgil van Dijk completed a full training session ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup final against Flamengo on Saturday.

The Liverpool centre back has recovered from an illness, which ruled him out of the Club World Cup semi-final victory against Monterrey on Wednesday evening.

Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, who was previously injured, also trained with Klopp's squad, who sit top of the Premier League table by a massive 10 points.

The Reds were in high spirits on the eve of their eagerly-anticipated final, having secured their spot in the showpiece event thanks to goals from Naby Keita and Roberto Firmino against Monterrey.

Asked if Van Dijk and Wijnaldum would be available for Saturday's final, Klopp said: 'We will see on both things actually.

'Virgil was part of training today. Gini had a session today. We will see how it looks at the end.

'We have no new injury concerns. We will use each hour for recovery and we will see who we can line up tomorrow.'

Prior to training on Friday, every member of the Liverpool squad sang happy birthday in their own language to Sepp van den Berg, who has just turned 18.
