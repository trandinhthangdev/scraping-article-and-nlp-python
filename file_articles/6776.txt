Workers over 50 are scared to admit it for fear their age will count against them.

They believe bosses and younger colleagues will view them as too old and in the way.

Nearly one in ten employees will not even tell workmates when they hit half a century.

And two in five over-50s think their age will bar them from promotion or pay rises.

The survey was carried out by Opinium among more than 3,000 people – including nearly 800 senior managers – for the AIG Life insurance combine.

Spokesman Lee Lovett said: ‘It is sad so many worry about their age because employment among the over-50s is at a record high.

‘Businesses accept that workforces are ageing and need to be supported. They are adapting.’

Among workers under 40, more than half fear their careers will begin to stall at 50.

Mr Lovett added: ‘Our earlier research found some people want to work into their 70s and can bring a huge amount of knowledge and experience.

‘Society needs to see every generation of worker as an integral asset yet there is clearly still some level of ageism across employees of all ages as the shy over-50s are not alone in their feelings.

'Younger workers are also worried about older colleagues blocking their careers while also worrying about what effect turning 50 will have on their careers in turn.

‘It would be interesting to understand where this employee ageism is derived because businesses accept that workforces are ageing and need to be supported - they are adapting and recognising that there are benefits to an older workforce.’
