FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) - Patriots cornerback Jason McCourty is back for New England's game against the Buffalo Bills after missing one game with a groin injury.

Defensive back Jonathan Jones was out, also with a groin injury, after missing all week in practice.

Buffalo tackle Ty Nsekhe missed his fifth straight game with an ankle injury, but defensive lineman Corey Liuget returned after missing one game with a knee injury.

The Patriots could clinch their 11th straight division title with a victory. If the Bills win, they would still need a victory next week and New England to lose to Miami to claim Buffalo's first AFC East crown since 1995. Both teams have already clinched playoff berths.

Also sitting out for the Bills are running back T.J. Yeldon, safety Dean Marlowe, offensive lineman Ike Boettger, receiver Duke Williams, tight end Tommy Sweeney and defensive lineman Vincent Taylor.

Also sitting out for New England are quarterback Cody Kessler, offensive linemen Jermaine Eluemunor and Korey Cunningham, tight end Ryan Izzo, running back Damien Harris, and defensive lineman Byron Cowart.
