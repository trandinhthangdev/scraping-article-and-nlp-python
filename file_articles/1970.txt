Clayton Beathard, the brother of San Francisco 49ers quarterback C.J. Beathard, was stabbed to death early Saturday in Nashville, Tenn., police said. He was 22.

Metro Nashville police said Paul Trapeni III, 21, also was killed following a dispute that began in a bar.

"The fatal stabbings appear to have resulted from an argument over a woman that began inside Dogwood Bar and then turned physical when the parties went outside. Multiple persons were involved in the outdoor fight during which the two men were both fatally stabbed in their sides," the police statement read.

The 49ers released a statement Saturday afternoon that said C.J. Beathard had left the team. San Francisco hosts the Los Angeles Rams on Saturday night.

"We extend our heartfelt sympathies to C.J. and the entire Beathard family as they cope with the unthinkable loss of a loved one," the team statement read, in part. "C.J. has traveled home to join the family knowing he has the support of our entire organization as they grieve the passing of Clayton."

Clayton Beathard played football in 2019 at Long Island University after transferring from Iowa Western Community College. A quarterback, he appeared in seven games, throwing for 1,071 yards and four touchdowns before suffering a season-ending injury.

He was the grandson of Hall of Fame member Bobby Beathard, who won four Super Bowls as a general manager in the NFL.

Beathard's parents, Casey and Susan Beathard, released a statement to The Tennessean that read, in part, "Clay was an amazing, big and soft-hearted human being with an undeniable love for the Lord. He had his family's, friends' and teammates' backs even to a fault. I wish he would have been more inclined to take the high road, but he hated 'wrong.'"

Police said the investigation is continuing.
