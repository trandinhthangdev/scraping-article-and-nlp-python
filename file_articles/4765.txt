Regis Healthcare is the latest nursing home operator to report sliding occupancy rates, with "industry pressures" and the royal commission also forcing the company to slash profit guidance.

Shares in the listed care provider slumped more than 17 per cent to a three-month low in early trade on Friday after Regis made a 12.4 per cent cut to its full-year earnings outlook to $92 million on continually falling occupancy rates.

Regis also made a 26.3 per cent cut to normalised net profit guidance - which is now expected to be $28 million - as it continues to count the cost of responding to the aged care services royal commission.

The interim report from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety in October described the nation's aged care system as being in a "shocking tale of neglect" following evidence of widespread mistreatment and substandard care.

Regis' financial year to date occupancy at December 2019 was 92 per cent, with spot occupancy at December 17 just 91.5 per cent, compared with 92.4 per cent as at June 30.

"This is due to continued challenging industry conditions and is consistent with sector experience," the company said, highlighting that wider industry occupancy was at 89.4 per cent for FY19, the lowest in three years.

Shares in Regis were down 16.82 per cent at $2.64 by 1241 AEST, the lowest since September, and nearly 30 per cent down since the royal commission was announced 15 months ago.

Earlier this month Estia Health were battered after it said poor press from the aged care royal commission had hurt occupancy rates.

Estia said spot occupancy had slipped 0.6 per cent across its 6,000-bed portfolio since August to 93.5 per cent, reflecting "current sector dynamics and public sentiment".
