MEXICO CITY, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Mexico has extradited a son of drug lord Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada to the United States to face trial on narcotics trafficking charges, a government official and media reports said on Friday.

The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that Ismael Zambada Imperial, 35, was extradited on Thursday.

Mexican newspaper Reforma said the younger Zambada was sent to the United States to face drug trafficking charges and had had a hearing in front of a judge in San Diego on Friday.

According to the website of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Zambada, who was captured in 2014, is wanted on drugs charges in the Southern District of California.

Veteran trafficker "El Mayo" Zambada is one of the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, once fronted by imprisoned kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman. The elder Zambada remains at large.

Security experts say "El Mayo" has long overseen much of the outfit's international drug trafficking operations.

Spokespeople for the Mexican foreign ministry, the security ministry and the presidency did not respond to requests for comment. (Reporting by Lizbeth Diaz and Dave Graham; Editing by Stephen Coates)
