Arsenal fans surrounded Robbie Lyle from Gunners fan channel AFTV telling them to 'get out of our club' on Saturday.

Lyle, who interviews fans after Arsenal games to get their thoughts on the match, was seen arguing with an angry supporter outside Goodison Park whilst others chanted at the media organisation to stay away.

The Gunners drew 0-0 to Everton in a game in which new managers Carlo Ancelotti and Mikel Arteta were in the stands.

Lyle interviews fans after Arsenal games to get their thoughts on the match they just watched

Some Arsenal fans have got restless with AFTV because they are known for posting videos containing thoughts which heavily criticise the club.

Lyle in the past has defended the channel insisting that there are many positive interviews also.

Such division among supporters is symptomatic of Arsenal's malaise and Arteta will be looking to bring back some much-needed positivity.

It was on the pitch that Ancelotti and Arteta learned the size of the tasks ahead of them as they watched Everton and Arsenal play out a drab goalless draw.

Everton announced shortly before the match that Ancelotti had signed a four-and-a-half-year deal, while Arteta was also in the stands having put pen to paper at Arsenal on Friday.

Ancelotti certainly represents a coup on paper for Everton given his CV, but lifting the Toffees out of their current malaise represents a very different challenge to his usual task of delivering silverware at the world's biggest clubs.

The 60-year-old immediately confirmed that he would be retaining the services of coach Duncan Ferguson, praising the Scot for his work as interim boss.
