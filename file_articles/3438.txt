The Miami Marlins gave their bullpen a boost on Friday, announcing the team signed right-hander Yimi Garcia to a one-year deal.

The deal was originally reported last week. Details of the contract were not revealed.

Garcia, 29, had been non-tendered by the Los Angeles Dodgers, despite posting a 3.61 ERA in 64 appearances in 2019. He also tied a Dodgers record for a reliever by giving up 15 home runs.

The move reunites Garcia with Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who was his skipper for 67 appearances over the 2014 and 2015 seasons with the Dodgers. Garcia had a combined 3.11 ERA in those campaigns.

Garcia is 5-11 lifetime with a 3.66 ERA over 165 appearances with the Dodgers. He started one game and saved one game in 2015 and missed the 2017 season after Tommy John surgery.

To make room for Garcia, the Marlins designated righthander Kyle Keller for assignment.
