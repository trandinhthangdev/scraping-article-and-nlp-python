Kell Brook is set to make his eagerly-anticipated return to the ring against Mark DeLuca in early 2020 in Sheffield.

The former IBF welterweight champion (38-2, 26 KOs) last fought a year ago when he defeated Australia's Michael Zerafa on points.

The Sheffield fighter, trained by Dominic Ingle, will be aiming to overcome any ring rust against DeLuca at the FlyDSA Arena on February 8 as he attempts to put his name back into the mix for a world title shot next year.

'I'm so happy to be back and I can't wait to put on a performance for my city on February 8 live on Sky Sports and DAZN,' said Brook.

'I've had a year out, there has been some dark times but what I've realised is I love this sport and I know I have some of my biggest years left in the game.

'DeLuca is a strong, gutsy fighter who is always ready for war but I'm planning on putting on a statement and showing the world that I'm still a force at 154 or 147lbs.'

American DeLuca (24-1, 13 KOs) is a southpaw hailing from Whitman in Massachusetts and is nicknamed 'The Bazooka'.
