North America trade pact deals rare setback to Big Pharma

WASHINGTON (AP) - A revamped North American trade deal nearing passage in Congress gives both the White House and Democrats a chance to claim victory. But the pact leaves at least one surprising loser: the pharmaceutical industry, a near-invincible lobbying powerhouse in Washington. To satisfy House Democrats, the Trump administration removed a provision that would have given the makers of ultra-expensive biologic drugs 10 years of protection from less expensive knockoffs. Democrats opposed what they called a giveaway to the industry that could have locked in inflated prices by stifling competition. Top biologics include drugs that fight cancer and immune disorders.

After ebullient 2019, Wall Street warns of slower road ahead

NEW YORK (AP) - Wall Street is telling investors to expect less from their investments next year following a fabulous 2019. It's not because Wall Street sees the economy falling into a recession, at least not in 2020. It's a simple matter of math. Analysts say stocks and bonds don't have as much room to rise after their stellar 2019, when nearly everything rose in concert. Plus, one of the major reasons for the big gains this year can't happen again. The Federal Reserve has already come to the rescue once with a major about-face on interest rates.

BEIJING (AP) - Chinese tech companies including social media giant Tencent have been ordered by regulators to clean up how their apps handle user information or face possible penalties. The industry ministry said 41 apps failed an examination following orders to ensure they comply with user data rules. The operators cited include major social media and news services such as Tencent's QQ messaging app, Sina Sports, Sohu News and Xiaomi Finance. The ministry said violations included improperly collecting or using information about visitors to their services. Chinese authorities encourage internet and social media use but have steadily tightened censorship and controls on what companies can do with information they gather.

Big spending bill wins Senate OK, has victories all around

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate has passed a $1.4 trillion government spending package in what amounted to a last, bipartisan burst of legislating before the end-of-the-year holidays. The Senate cleared the two-bill package in a set of votes Thursday and sent it to President Donald Trump in time to forestall a possible government shutdown this weekend. The White House says Trump will sign it before Friday's midnight deadline. The legislation gives Trump a victory on his U.S.-Mexico border fence but also gives Democrats long-sought domestic spending increases and a repeal of Obama-era taxes on high-cost health insurance plans.

Its provisions include making it easier for small businesses to band together to offer retirement plans to employees.
