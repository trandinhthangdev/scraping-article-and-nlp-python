A British woman jailed for spying in Iran has lost her bid for an early release from prison.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, who worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in April 2016 and sentenced to five years in prison for allegedly planning the 'soft toppling' of Iran's government. Her family has denied all the allegations against her.

Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's lawyer, Mahmoud Behzadi Rad, said he had submitted a request for a 'conditional release' – when convicts have served half their sentence, they can apply for release and the courts have the power to grant it for good behaviour. It was not revealed why the request was denied.

In England, her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has been leading a campaign to try to win his wife's release.

The lawyer also said that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has had several psychiatric evaluations recently while in prison but did not elaborate on her condition or the state of her health.

Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe went on a 15-day hunger strike in June, to call attention to her plight.

In July, she was moved to the mental health ward of Imam Khomeini hospital under the control of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

The Free Nazanin Campaign said in a statement at the time that it does not know what treatment she is receiving or how long she is expected to remain in the hospital.

Iran has also detained at least one other Iranian-British national, anthropologist Kameel Ahmady, who has been accused of spying and of links to foreign intelligence agencies.
