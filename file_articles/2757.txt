Daniel Jacobs earned a victory by technical knockout Friday night when Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. quit after the fifth round with what he said was a broken hand.

The crowd in Phoenix flooded the ring with debris after the bout was stopped.

Jacobs (36-3, 30 KOs) was ahead on the cards of multiple boxing writers at the time of the stoppage. The 32-year-old New York native is a former world middleweight champion.

"This is the biggest opponent I've ever had in my career. I did my part," Jacobs said post-fight, according to The Athletic.

Chavez, a 33-year-old Mexico native and former world middleweight champion, saw his record fall to 51-4-1 record with 33 knockouts.

The ending of the fight matched the bizarre lead-up. Chavez failed to meet the prescribed 168-pound weight limit when he weighed at 172.6 pounds on Thursday. Jacobs weighed in at 167.9 pounds.

The fight only proceeded as scheduled when Chavez agreed to hand over $1 million of his approximately $3 million purse, according to multiple media outlets.
