Melbourne Stars have won the toss and will bat first in the Big Bash League match against Hobart Hurricanes in Moe.

The Stars will aim to mount a competitive total on a pitch that is already showing cracks and is expected to make life difficult for batters later in the day.

Mac Wright will make his debut for the Hurricanes and Tom Rogers has been called into the side, with George Bailey and James Faulkner rested after the win over Sydney Sixers in the oppressive Alice Springs heat.

The Stars will be without boom recruit Dale Steyn (side strain) and fellow paceman Nathan Coulter-Nile (ankle) for a second successive match.

Both sides are unbeaten this season.

Melbourne Stars: Hilton Cartwright, Ben Dunk, Peter Handscomb, Clint Hinchliffe, Sandeep Lamichhane, Nic Maddinson, Glenn Maxwell (capt), Haris Rauf, Marcus Stoinis, Daniel Worrall, Adam Zampa.

Hobart Hurricanes: Qais Ahmad, Nathan Ellis, Caleb Jewell, Ben McDermott (capt), Riley Meredith, Simon Milenko, David Miller, Tom Rogers, Clive Rose, D'Arcy Short, Mac Wright.
