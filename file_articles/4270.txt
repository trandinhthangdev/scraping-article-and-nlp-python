Strong men who have to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain their incredibly muscular bodies have revealed exactly what their day on a plate looks like.

Brothers Luke and Tom Stoltman, who are competing in the upcoming Britain's Strongest Man competition, admit it's tough to consume so much food, and they're constantly left feeling bloated on a diet of whey protein, tuna, pasta and lots of red meat.

Meanwhile Zake Muluzi, who is also competing for the title, munches through his calories by splitting them into 10 meals a day.

Speaking about his eating regime with strength and conditioning equipment provider, MiraFit, Luke, 35, said: 'Eating 10,000 calories every day is pretty horrendous, I'm walking around like a bloated whale most of the time.'

Tom added: 'Eating chicken and rice every day gets boring, particularly when you've got a missus, and we tend to have a takeaway and go on dates. It makes sticking to a diet hard.'

But their immense strength has a knock-on effect when it comes to shopping. Luke added: 'You can't just go to the shops and buy clothes.

'That's why Tom and I wear shorts most of the time because trying to find jeans or trousers that fit is so frustrating.'

And the brothers' size struggles go beyond trying to fit into clothes. Tom explained: 'Travelling is a nightmare for me.

'Especially if you have to sit beside someone on a flight or you're in the middle. My legs are extra long [Tom is 6ft 9ins] my feet are long [size 19]. Everything is long,' he said.

With both of them pursuing relatively extreme lifestyles, the brothers admitted they often get asked if there's a sibling rivalry.

Luke said: 'When we're in that competitive zone, he's another athlete, but at the same time I get quite emotional competing with Tom because he's still my baby brother, so I want to see him do as well as he can.

'For me it's pride, I have a great deal of pride watching him compete.'

Tom, who has been Strongman training for eight years, revealed that he owes a lot of his success to his brother.

'If Luke didn't do Strongman, I would be playing football or doing something else,' he said.

'If he didn't compete I never ever would have thought to do Strongman. If Luke didn't have me and I didn't have him, we wouldn't be as good as we are.'

Luke's advice for those who want to train to be a Strongman competitor is to learn the basics first.

'Learn the compounds, do your deadlifts, squats, bench press, overhead press. Do these four and hone them in,' he said.

'Working full time and being a top-level Strongman isn't easy,'
