The Wizards drew within 10 points, but the Raptors led 68-52 at halftime when Anunoby made a running dunk to complete the scoring after Ibaka blocked a shot.

Washington scored the first six points of the second half, trimming the lead to 10. But Ibaka's 3-pointer with 6:40 left in the third quarter bumped the lead to 15. Beal pulled the Wizards within nine points on a jumper and a free throw. Hollis-Jefferson ended the third-quarter scoring with a layup and the Raptors led 96-85.
