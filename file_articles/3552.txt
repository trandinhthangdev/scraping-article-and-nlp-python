CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Detectives fatally shot a suspect who they say pulled a gun on them in the parking lot of a North Carolina apartment complex.

Kyle Horton, 31, was a suspect in a kidnapping, carjacking at gunpoint and armed robbery across two states, New Hanover County Sheriff's Office Lt. J.J. Brewer said in a release.

Detectives received information that Horton was headed to the Wilmington area on Tuesday and then saw him drive into the apartment complex parking lot, Brewer said. He was killed in a confrontation with law enforcement, the release said.

Horton was accused of kidnapping and carjacking a 30-year-old woman at gunpoint last Friday at a shopping center in Charlotte, news outlets reported. The woman told police she was kidnapped in her own SUV and driven to South Carolina, where Horton let her go, according to news outlets.

Horton was also person of interest in an armed robbery Tuesday, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, police spokesman Cpl. Thomas Vest told news outlets.

Kaylee Lewis told Myrtle Beach television station WMBF-TV that she encountered Horton before he was shot and killed. She says he opened her car door, pointed a gun at her and searched through her belongings for money. She told him she was "broke" and she had a 5-year-old daughter.

"(He) threw down my wallet, threw everything that he had in his lap down and that's when he put his hand on my shoulder and said, `Lock your doors, don´t let this happen to you again,' and left my vehicle," Lewis said.

New Hanover County Sheriff Ed McMahon has asked the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation to take over the case, Brewer said.
