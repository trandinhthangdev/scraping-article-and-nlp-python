A neighbor watched in amazement as a delivery driver spent 25 minutes building a wall of parcels all for one house.

The footage was captured by someone who lives opposite the home who decided to film the UPS delivery driver from their window in the US.

It shows a delivery man making several trips to and from his loaded lorry to leave piles of cardboard packages - believed to be from Amazon Prime - in front of someone's garage.

He grabs four or five packages at a time and hauls them up on to his shoulder before lining them up next to the home.

After a few minutes the front of the garage is completely stacked with boxes, with the delivery man struggling to find places to put them.

Eventually the piles reach two rows deep as the filmer chuckles along at the scene unfolding in front of him.

The video was uploaded to Instagram yesterday with the caption 'neighbours went in' and already has over two million views.

Social media users were quick to react to the video with one saying: 'Please tip this man.'
