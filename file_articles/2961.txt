Peter Wright came dressed as an elf and narrowly avoided being left on the shelf after a deciding-set tie-break at the PDC World Championship.

Flamboyant Wright, the world number seven, donned his Christmas finery to battle past Filipino Noel Malicdem in a dramatic late-night finish at Alexandra Palace.

The 49-year-old from Scotland, runner-up in 2014, did not look as sharp as his attire and was on the brink of defeat at two legs down in the deciding set.

The flamboyant Scot was made to work for his win, being taken to a final set tie-break decider

He had squandered a match dart in the fourth set, missing double top, and then watched on as Malicdem fluffed a bullseye to win it in the fifth.

Malicdem had four darts at double 13 to go 5-4 up with the throw but could not finish the job, and Wright somehow survived to take the deciding leg and stagger into the third round.

Youngster Nico Kurz caused a minor shock when he beat out-of-sorts 15th seed Joe Cullen 3-1 and a second German, Max Hopp, won all three legs in the deciding set to oust Dutchman Benito Van De Pas.

Stockport's Nathan Aspinall, a semi-finalist last year, recovered from dropping the opening set to beat America's Danny Baggish 3-1.

In the afternoon session, Ricky Evans' 3-1 win over Mark McGeeney, sealed with a 170 checkout, earned him a third-round meeting with top seed Michael Van Gerwen.

Darren Webster breezed through 3-0 against Japan's Yuki Yamada and Mervyn King surrendered a two-set advantage before coming through a tie-break with Irish debutant Ciaran Teehan, while Jonny Clayton beat Jan Dekker 3-0.
