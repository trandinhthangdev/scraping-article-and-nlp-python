NASHVILLE (AP) - It was a big night for Aaron Nesmith as the Vanderbilt sophomore tied his career high with 34 points by hitting a career-tying 7 3-pointers on 10 attempts and was 9 of 11 from the free throw line.

While Commodores coach Jerry Stackhouse was impressed with Nesmith큦 performance, he wasn큧 very happy with the rest of his team큦 play in an 88-73 Vanderbilt victory over North Carolina-Wilmington on Saturday night.

"For us to be a good team, we have got to get more contributions from more guys," Stackhouse said. "It큦 not just about (Nesmith) having a big 25-point or 30-point game. It would be better for our team maybe if he had 20, and we could get some contributions in other areas, because that큦 what we are going to need. That큦 the way we have to play to be a good team."

Saben Lee added 14 points for Vanderbilt (7-4).

Vanderbilt held its largest lead at 78-56 with 4:44 to go in the game, but UNC-Wilmington went on a 9-0 run to cut the lead to 11 on a Jalen Sims 3-pointer at 2:23. The Seahawks (5-8) never got closer.

"The thing that really hurt us is our turnovers," said UNC-Wilmington coach C.B. McGrath, whose team committed 23. "We shot a really good percentage, we were taking good shots, but when you turn it over it큦 just hard to overcome."

Sims led the Seahawks with 19 points. Mike Okauru threw in 12, Kai Toews added 11, and Brian Tolefree had 10.

Nesmith entered the game third in the nation in 3-pointers made per game (4.0) and hit that many in the first half as Vanderbilt took a 42-32 lead with Nesmith accounting for 20.

UNC-Wilmington traded baskets early, then used an 8-2 run to tie the game at 13 at 12:23 in the first half. Vanderbilt built its biggest lead of the half at 42-29 on a layup and free-throw by Lee, but the Seahawks answered with a 3-pointer by Sims at the buzzer.

Despite being without their best inside offensive threat and leading rebounder, Clevon Brown, who missed his second game in a row with a knee injury, the Commodores outscored UNC-Wilmington 30-22 in the paint.
