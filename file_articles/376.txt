Seven men have been charged over a pub brawl that resulted in the death of Victorian teenager Patrick Cronin more than three-and-a-half years ago.

Up to 30 patrons were involved in the fight at the Diamond Creek pub, in Melbourne's northeast, about 11pm on 16 April 2016.

The 19-year-old footballer was hit in a one-punch attack outside the venue. He walked to his Eltham home and was taken to hospital, where he later died.

"We're pleased to see charges being laid today. We know we need to wait for the right process to follow, but we look forward to an outcome," parents Matt and Robyn Cronin said on Monday.

"Christmas should be a time of celebration for the family and here we are more than three years later, and we still haven't received closure."

"It's something we live with every day, the loss of Pat," they said.

Three men from Diamond Creek aged 34, 34 and 36 along with a 35-year-old Eltham North man, a 30-year-old man from Montmorency, a 35-year-old Panton Hill man and a 32-year-old Greensborough have all been charged.

The men have been charged on summons with affray and will appear in Heidelberg Magistrates Court in May.

Andrew William Lee was jailed in 2017 for eight years after pleading guilty to hitting the teenager outside the pub.

In August, Lee was ordered by the Supreme Court to pay $170,972 in compensation to the young man's family.
