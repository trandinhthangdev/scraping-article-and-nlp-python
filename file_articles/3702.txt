A Utah woman has been arrested for allegedly buying a biological agent of mass destruction online.

Janie Lynn Ridd, 50, was arrested on Wednesday after authorities started monitoring her activity when they realized she was trying to buy the possible biological agent.

Her arrest affidavit, obtained by Deseret News, said Ridd ended up buying the agent but authorities would not give specific details about what she had purchased.

Investigators said Ridd could not provide any evidence to show that she had lawful authority to possess the agent.

Police said that despite the seriousness of the alleged crime, they do not believe Ridd had any intention of carrying out mass destruction of any kind.

In Utah, a biological agent of mass destruction can be 'any microorganism, virus, infectious substance or biological product' that is capable of causing death, destruction of food or water supplies or harms the environment.

Authorities said further details about the agent Ridd allegedly bought would be revealed when she was formally charged.

The Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement that 'law enforcement officials became aware of Ridd attempting to purchase a possible biological agent.

'They were able to safely monitor Ridd's activity. After which, Ridd was arrested.

'There was never a threat to the general public prior to, or after, Ridd's arrest.'

Both federal and state authorities, including the State Bureau of Investigations, FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service were all involved in the investigation in Ridd.

Ridd is facing possible federal charges.
