A young migrant boy from Iraq 'who entered the UK illegally' has been found wandering on the M6 after the youngster 'lost his parents' and has no idea where they are.

The Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) said they found the boy on Wednesday night after responding to reports of a pedestrian on the motorway near Birmingham.

He is unable to speak English and officers have taken him to a place of safety.

In a statement the CMPG said: 'He was split up from his parents a few days ago, and doesn't know which country they're in.

'It's impossible to imagine how scared someone would be, not knowing where they are, not knowing where their parents are, unable to speak the language.

'We've taken him to a place of safety with food and water until social services can come and take him to care.'

A police spokesman added: 'It's understood the male - whose age has not been verified - is from Iraq and the matter has been passed to immigration.'
