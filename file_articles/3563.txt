Glenn Maxwell admits the lure of a home T20 World Cup at the start of next summer is hard to look past when discussing his future ambitions.

Maxwell made an eye-catching return to professional cricket after a two-month break due to mental health issues in Friday's Big Bash League game between Melbourne Stars and Brisbane Heat.

The allrounder smashed 83 off just 39 deliveries as the Stars began their tournament with a 22-run win at Metricon Stadium.

While admitting his omission earlier this week from Australia's squad for next month's three-match ODI tour of India was disappointing, Maxwell had far from given up on returning to the national team in the future.

"Yeah certainly, especially with the T20 World Cup around the corner," he said.

"There's that big carrot I suppose at the start of next season and I'll be doing everything I can to work towards that."

Given his lack of match time and uncertainty over his form, Maxwell could understand why he'd been left out of the one-day team.

"I probably haven't dwelled on it as much as I probably did in the past," he said.

"I suppose not shelving it and just not thinking about it, being able to have the conversations with people about it and deal with it appropriately.

"That's probably something I haven't done very well in the past and to be able to get through the other side and perform well, really makes a big difference."

Maxwell was also given a boost on the eve of his playing return, being picked up by Kings XI Punjab in Thursday's IPL auction on a $2.91m contract.

"I was extremely happy. We were following it with coaching staff," Maxwell said.

"We were watching all the Stars players come out and when my name came out we were just refreshing like mad. Couldn't watch it anywhere so we were just watching it on the Twitter feed.

"Very exciting and glad to be going home to the Kings XI. I've got a lot of great memories there, had four really good years there so looking forward to getting back."
