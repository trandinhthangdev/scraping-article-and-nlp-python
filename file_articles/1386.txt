Virgil van Dijk admitted he was disappointed not to win the Ballon d'Or ahead of Lionel Messi.

The Liverpool defender missed out on the honour by a measly seven votes last month.

The Holland international also told the Mirror that he knew he was not going to win before going to the ceremony.

Lionel Messi's mum said the Barcelona star did not expect to win the Ballon d'Or last month

'I was slightly disappointed,' said the man who became a ­£75million bargain since arriving at Anfield from Southampton two years ago.

'I decided I would still go to the ceremony – and, in the end, it was a super night.

'I spoke to Messi during the ­evening. It was not the longest ­conversation because he doesn't speak a lot of English.

'But it was still enough to make me realise that the respect between us now also runs the other way.'

Messi was not expecting to win the trophy according to his mother.

In an interview with CNN radio, Messi's mother said last month: 'I am very happy. We were not expecting this.

'We thought the fifth had been the last. Honestly, this was a beautiful surprise. He (Messi) did not expect it either.

'I do not know if he found out minutes before, I do not know, but we did not know anything.'
