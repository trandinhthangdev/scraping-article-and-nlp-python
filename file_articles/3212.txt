FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) - The Atlanta Falcons placed offensive guard James Carpenter on injured reserve Friday and re-signed lineman Sean Harlow.

Carpenter was ruled out of Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars with a concussion. With only one more game to go in a disappointing season, the Falcons (5-9) decided to place the 30-year-old on IR.

Carpenter started all 11 games he played for Atlanta after signing as a free agent in March.

Harlow was a fourth-round selection in 2017 who has played in only one game, spending most of his time on the Falcons practice squad.
