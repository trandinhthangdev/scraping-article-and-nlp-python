She kept her legs warm with a pair of medium-wash jeans at an ankle length.

Nicky wed businessman James Rothschild, 34, in 2015, and they share two daughters, Lily Grace, three, and Teddy, one.

The sighting comes two weeks after the fashion designer and charity board member told Daily Mail Australia that motherhood inspires her 'to be the best version' of herself.

'I love watching Lily Grace and Teddy learn and grow. I also love watching my husband be such a wonderful father, it just melts me.'

Nicky also doesn't mind whether her children end up working in showbiz, as long as they have 'purpose and passion'.

'I will always tell my children: whatever you do, make sure you have purpose and passion. That is the recipe for success,' she added.

Prior to her current union, Nicky was wed to ex-husband Todd Meister for less than three months in 2004.
