New Zealand's economy continues to grow impressively, with gross domestic product rising 0.7 per cent in the September quarter.

Figures released by Stats NZ on Thursday showed retail spending and primary industries growth powered the result, well above expectations.

The headline figure of 2.3 per cent annual growth continues to be near the forefront of growth rates among OECD countries.

Stats NZ national accounts senior manager Gary Dunnet suggested consumer spending was a big part of the uptick.

'Retail industry growth of 2.4 per cent in the quarter was boosted by robust spending on electronics such as appliances, mobile phones, and computers after a quieter period in the June quarter,' he said.

An ANZ Research summary said they expected growth would 'bob around two per cent into early 2020'.
