BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) - Jay Rodriguez scored a late winner as Burnley snatched a 1-0 victory in a bad-tempered Premier League game at Bournemouth on Saturday.

Substitute Rodriguez broke the deadlock at the Vitality Stadium in the 89th minute with the game's first attempt on target, scruffily converting into the bottom right corner with his chest following Ashley Westwood's cross.

A dismal match on a rain-soaked south coast was littered with second-half bookings and looked set to end in stalemate before the hosts were condemned to a third successive home defeat.

Burnley is 10th with 24 points from 18 games.

Bournemouth is four points above the relegation zone in 14th.
