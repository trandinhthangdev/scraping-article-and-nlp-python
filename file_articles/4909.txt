Volunteer firefighters should be compensated through tax breaks, one-off payments or special leave entitlements, the federal opposition believes.

Labor leader Anthony Albanese says the firefighters have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to their community and deserve an equal commitment back.

"We need to do more to make sure that people aren't out of pocket, that they're not in a position of choosing whether to go out on another run, or whether to have to go to work and provide for their family," he said.
