The ex-wife of a bass player who was in an 'extremely successful' band is to get a half share of his fortune, Mr Justice Mostyn (pictured) ruled

The ex-wife of a bass player who was in an 'extremely successful' band will get a half share of a £10million fortune, a High Court judge has decided.

Mr Justice Mostyn says the woman will get a £5million package, which includes a £2.3 million lump sum, following the breakdown of their marriage.

He outlined his decision after analysing evidence at a private hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London earlier this month, in a ruling published on December 20.

The man and no-one involved can be identified, the judge said.

He said the man played bass in a three-member band.

The band had released seven albums in the past 20 years, was well-known and 'extremely successful', the judge said.

Mr Justice Mostyn said he had been asked to assess the value of the man’s 'music income streams'.

The bass-player was part of a three-member well-known band which saw his 'music income streams' rake in more than £4m, the High Court (pictured, The Royal Courts of Justice) judge said in a ruling published on December 20. His ex-partner will get a £5million package, which includes a £2.3 million lump sum

He concluded the monetary value was worth more than £4million.

The pair had other assets of nearly £6 million and therefore total assets of about £10 million.

He said the bass player’s ex-wife would get half on an 'equal sharing' principle.
