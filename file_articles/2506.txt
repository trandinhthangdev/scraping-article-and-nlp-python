They were the most controversial couple of the last season of The Block.

On Saturday, the show's 'stylish grandfathers' Mitch Edwards and Mark McKie were living their most fabulous lives while luxuriating on a lavish boat at The Basin in Pittwater, NSW.

Mitch, 56, and Mark, 57, took to Instagram to share their 'indulgent' day-off, stripping down to their budgie smugglers and sipping on glasses of champagne while aboard their friend's boat.

Mitch styled $59.99 navy-blue Marcuse swimming briefs with an H&M straw hat and Quay Australia sunglasses.

Meanwhile, Mark wore a pair of Jimmy Choo sunglasses, covering up later in the day with a striped singlet and black board shorts.

'A beautiful day off, taking out time to appreciate each other and special friends,' the couple wrote on their shared social media account.

'We’ve been non-stop ever since we finished the Block and just haven’t contemplated relaxing, until friends insisted we take a day off and come out on their boat for the day on Pittwater. Wow, we need this day,' they added.

They also used their platform to bring awareness to the recent bush fire crisis.

'As much as we’re enjoying a day of chilled indulgence, being surrounded by smoke, can’t help but be anxious for way to many Australians suffering or in extreme danger,' they wrote.

The pair finished: 'Wow guys, crazy times.. We’re having a beautiful day and we wish you the same!'

They added a slew of hashtags, including #missnegroni, #mitchandmark, #timeouttoenjoy, #over50andfabulous and #hotolderguys.
