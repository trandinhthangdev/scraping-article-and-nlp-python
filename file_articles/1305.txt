Mikel Arteta is reportedly lining up Napoli star Dries Mertens as his first signing as new Arsenal manager.

Arteta was announced as Arsenal's new boss on Friday afternoon, replacing Unai Emery who was sacked at the end of November after a woeful start to the Premier League season.

And according to Calciomercato, Arteta is already lining up transfer business and is ready to fight it out for the signature of Belgium international Mertens.

Napoli star Dries Mertens is on the radar of Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund

However, the Gunners will face fierce competition from Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.

It is reported that Mertens - who is in the final year of his Napoli contract and looks set to be allowed to leave - may even be available for as little as £8.5million in January.

It would represent a brilliant piece of business by Arteta if he is able to acquire the services of Mertens, who has 118 goals and 71 assists in 303 matches for Napoli.

The former Arsenal midfielder was confirmed as manager on Friday, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract at the Emirates.

Arteta watched on from the stands at Goodison Park as Arsenal played out a drab goalless draw with Everton in the Premier League on Saturday.

The Gunners currently sit 11th in the Premier League, already six points behind the top four, having played a match more.
