Tyrese Haliburton scored 22 points and set a career high with six 3-pointers and Solomon Young added 15 points to spark Iowa State to an 89-59 rout over Purdue Fort Wayne on Sunday afternoon in Ames, Iowa.

The Cyclones (7-4) made 10 3-pointers in the first half to finish 14 of 30 from beyond the arc. They also corralled 35 rebounds and committed just eight turnovers.

The Mastodons (7-8) had three players finish in double figures, led by Jarred Godfrey's 17 points while Brian Patrick had 13 and Marcus DeBerry added 10 to go along with five rebounds.

Iowa State showed no ill effects from a 10-day break following its 84-68 loss to state rival Iowa, continuing its hot shooting from the first half by connecting on seven of its first 11 second-half shots to take a 67-37 lead with 12:13 left.

But Purdue Fort-Wayne managed to stay within striking distance, scoring 11 straight points to cut the deficit to 72-55 before the Cyclones pulled away with four straight points after a 3-pointer from Terrence Lewis.

The Cyclones made sure to avoid suffering an early Christmas letdown, shooting 60.6 percent (20-for-33) from the field, including 10-for-20 on 3-pointers to take a 50-28 lead into halftime.

It was the best shooting half of the season for the Cyclones, who made nine of their first 16 attempts from 3-point range against the Mastondons, relied on a 30-4 run to pull away for an easy win.

Haliburton led the 3-point barrage, connecting on five of his first seven shots from beyond the arc for 17 points at halftime.

Iowa State had 17 assists on its 33 first-half baskets to build a 26-point lead.

The Mastondons fell to 1-7 away from home due to a sluggish start. They made just four of their 14 first-half 3-point attempts and committed 11 turnovers and shot only four free throws.
