Mario Mandzukic has arrived in Qatar to seal a move to Al-Duhail as the Manchester United target edges closer to leaving Juventus.

The 33-year-old has long been keen to leave Italy behind after enduing a tumultous season in Turin, with manager Maurizio Sarri snubbing the Croat from his first team plans.

Mandzukic's future with Juve was further questioned when he was excluded from the club's Christmas celebrations earlier this month.

According to Sky Sports, Mandzukic has been spotted in Qatar with a January move to league leaders Al-Duhail looking all the more likely.

The former Bayern Munich man had been linked with a move to the Premier League, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer identifying Mandzukic as a potential answer to Manchester United's goalscoring conundrum.

However, United are seeking alternative options, with a move for Red Bull Salzburg forward Erling Haaland becoming a real possibility next month.

The 19-year-old, son of former Manchester City player Alf-Inge, spent time in Manchester this week, further amplifying rumours of a January move.

Solskjaer, however, insisted the teenager was in the city to spend time with friends on a holiday.
