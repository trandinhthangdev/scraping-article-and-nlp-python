Television selections for February's Premier League matches have been revealed with bosses revealing the split for clubs as part of the new winter break.

The winter break will take place over two weekends, with Premier League clubs set to be staggered in matches across the weekend of February 8 and 15.

The fixture release was delayed due to the Champions League and Europa League knockout stage draws taking place earlier this week, with the Premier League electing to work out their own fixtures before TV picks were made.

The televised BT and Sky fixtures for February have finally been released to supporters

Premier League clubs will have the luxury of a winter break for the first time in February

FEBRUARY WINTER BREAK GAMES SPLIT Saturday, February 8 12:30 Everton v Crystal Palace (BT Sport) 17:30 Brighton v Watford (BT Sport) Sunday February 9 14:00 Sheff Utd v AFC Bournemouth (BT Sport) 16:30 Man City v West Ham (Sky Sports) Friday February 14 20:00 Wolves v Leicester (BT Sport) Saturday February 15 12:30 Southampton v Burnley (BT Sport) 17:30 Norwich v Liverpool (Sky Sports) Sunday February 16 14:00 Aston Villa v Spurs (Sky Sports) 16:30 Arsenal v Newcastle (Sky Sports) Monday February 17 20:00 Chelsea v Man Utd (Sky Sports)

Frank Lampard's Chelsea have been moved three times with a lunchtime trip to take on title chasers Leicester before a Monday night meeting with Manchester United a week before the Mourinho reunion.

United have been moved four times but much of their fixtures hinges on their involvement in other cup competitions.

They are in the final four of the Carabao Cup and are also still competing in the Europa League.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side remain a big draw for television audiences and they will take on Wolves at Old Trafford in front of the Sky Sports cameras on February 1.

They then make the trip to Chelsea before a home game against Watford and a trip to Everton on March 1 caps off the Red Devils' fixture alterations from the latest broadcast schedule.

After Mikel Arteta swapped being Manchester City's assistant to take over at Arsenal, he will get a game against his old side in front of Sky's cameras for their first Super Sunday in March.

Sky have picked out three fixtures on that day as participation in the Carabao Cup final would rule a side out and so one of Manchester City or Manchester United, who meet in the two-legged semi-final, will be playing on Sky that day, rather than at Wembley.

Talk of a new manager at the Emirates Stadium has seen four matches selected for TV coverage including a trip to Turf Moor to face Burnley, home games against Newcastle United and Everton and the visit of current champions City.

Title favourites and current league leaders Liverpool have been selected three times in the month for their trip to Norwich on February 15.
