Edinson Cavani has agreed a three-year deal with Atletico Madrid according to Sky Sports Italia.

The Uruguay international will be a free agent in the summer when his contract expires.

Atletico will have to sell a number of players in order to fund the deal.

This is because the La Liga side believe they have too many players in the squad already and will have to cut down on their wage budget to afford Cavani.

Diego Simeone's side are working to bring in the PSG forward in January but they can agree a pre-contract for him to join in the summer for free anyway.

There is still no agreement with PSG to complete the deal in January as Atletico look to solve their striker crisis.

Diego Costa is currently injured and summer signing Joao Felix has not been living up to the heights expected. Alvaro Morata has had to carry the load.

Cavani is believed to be excited about joining up with Simeone who has been courting him for years.
