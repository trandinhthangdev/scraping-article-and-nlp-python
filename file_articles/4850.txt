Duke announced that sophomore guard Tre Jones would sit out Thursday night's game against visiting Wofford due to a mild sprain in his left foot.

"It is out of an abundance of caution that we're holding Tre out tonight," coach Mike Krzyzewski said in a statement. "We are confident this is minor, and we expect him back very soon."

The injury was sustained in practice. His 15.6 points per game are second-most on the team.

This will mark the second game in a row that Wofford will meet an Atlantic Coast Conference team that is without its normal starting point guard. North Carolina's Cole Anthony sat out his first game of the season Sunday when Wofford upset the Tar Heels in nearby Chapel Hill.

The fourth-ranked Blue Devils will meet the Terriers in their first home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium since Nov. 29.
