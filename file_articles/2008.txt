The head of Qatar's 2022 World Cup has told the Mail on Sunday that critics of the Gulf state's intolerance of LGBT rights should stop focusing on what is restrictive.

Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar — punishable with up to seven years in prison — and Supreme Committee Secretary General Hassan Al Thawadi reiterated on Sunday that the nation stands by its beliefs.

Straight and gay supporters are all being asked to avoid open signs of affection in public, in keeping with Qatari law.

Asked whether the nation would win more plaudits by tolerating relationships accepted in most parts of the world, Mr Al Thawadi replied: 'We are not saying, "Don't come and be yourself" but it's always important to be open-minded and not focus on what's restrictive. You are focusing on the negative.'

Mr Al Thawadi said: 'We want to change attitudes about Qataris. We want to break down the stereotypes.'
