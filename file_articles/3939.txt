This is the shocking moment a brazen motorist is caught driving down the freeway in reverse.

The incident was filmed by another driver in Detroit, Michigan earlier this month.

Footage shows the person driving the car in reverse as they pass by gas stations, restaurants and other vehicles.

The video begins with the person filming driving their car down a busy highway at night time.

The filmer then zooms in on a pair of headlights facing in the wrong direction in the lane to the right of them.

As the picture becomes more clear it is revealed that the car is actually driving backwards at a high speed.

The car filming then draws level with the silver saloon car as it continues its way dangerously down the highway.

The driver even manages to maintain a relatively constant speed throughout the unconventional journey.

Other road users then stop to see what is happening and eventually the filmer drives away.

He can be heard laughing as he takes in the scene that unfolds in front of him.
