One Florida family received an slithery Holiday greeting when a nine-ft long Burmese Python appeared in their yard this week.

Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officers responded to a home in Key Largo near mile marker 104 on Monday night after the family alerted them to the large reptile's presence.

Officers Billy Thompson, Zack Hoppe and Dylan Weichban arrived at the scene and captured the invasive snake, according to a press release from the FWC.

The snake was taken back to the Whale Harbor FWC Base in Islamorada and 'dispatched.'

FWC spokesman Officer Bobby Dube told the Miami Herald that the officers chopped off the snake's head.

According to the FWC's website, the Burmese python is an invasive species in Florida that is a threat to native wildlife.

The large nonvenomous constrictor is primarily found in the Everglades ecosystem in south Florida.

While the FWC works to manage the invasive population, the agency advises for people to humanely kill the reptiles on their private lands.

Pythons can also be killed at any of the 22 Wildlife Management Areas, Public Small Game Hunting Areas and Wildlife and Environmental Areas where pythons are known to exist.

Firearms and traps are the two methods that are not allowed when hunting the pythons.
