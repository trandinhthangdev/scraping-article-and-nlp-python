A Canadian dad wore a t-shirt saying 'I am not Scott Morrison' to stop him getting abused by angry voters in Australia.

The dad was pictured on holiday in the Gold Coast wearing the customised clothing.

His daughter uploaded the images to Reddit and said: 'My dad kept getting recognized as Scomo so my sis and I made him a shirt to keep him safe while travelling Australia.'

Commenters noted the middle-aged father resembled Scott Morrison in his age, build and facial features as well as having similar hair and glasses.

The Prime Minister has suffered a major backlash this week over his handling of the bushfire crisis.

Voters were enraged that Mr Morrison took an overseas holiday to Hawaiian while the rest of the country suffered.

Reddit users were quick to appreciate the sisters' sense of humour and cracked jokes at the Prime Minister's expense.

One commented: 'Scotty would probably like one of those shirts at the moment as well.'

Another user was sympathetic to their situation and said: 'Your poor Dad! It's like a curse.'
