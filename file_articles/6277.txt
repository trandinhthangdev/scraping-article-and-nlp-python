An UberEats delivery rider has been captured using the toilet with their food delivery bag inside the cubicle.

The photo was posted on Facebook showing a delivery rider shot from underneath the cubicle wall.

The delivery bag is tucked between the rider's legs, with their pants around their ankles on the toilet.

It is not known whether there was food in the delivery bag at the time the photo was taken.

Many were outraged at the post, with some saying they would be 'disturbed' if the delivery bag was heading for their front door.

Other comments noted the strange angle of the photo from beside the cubicle.

'You usually look under the stalls when you use a public toilet? Whatever floats your boat I guess,' one comment reads.

Uber's community guidelines say: 'We understand that you may have some negative experiences with riders, and our rating system is in place to help keep Uber comfortable and safe for everyone.'
