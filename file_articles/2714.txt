A strong all-round display has enabled the Australia A women's cricket team to continue their domination of India A through a T20 series-clinching victory on the Gold Coast.

After sweeping the three-match one-day series, Australia are on track to emulate that achievement after claiming the second T20 clash by 37 runs at Bill Pippen Oval on Saturday.

Australia's 7-148 was defended with ease as India were restricted to 8-108.

Opener Tahlia McGrath's 46 from 40 balls and a rapid 37 off 27 balls from Bridget Patterson laid the platform before Sammy-Jo Johnson cracked 24 from a dozen deliveries, including two sixes.

Australia, who won the opening T20 clash by nine wickets, then applied the clamps as Molly Strano (2-6) and Maitland Brown (2-15) ensured India's chase never gained any traction.

Strano, seeking a recall to the top Australian line-up, has taken 11 wickets in five games against the tourists, including talented teenager Shalifa Verma (1) on four occasions.

India A captain Veda Krishnamurthy added some respectability to the innings with 38 from 35 balls.

Game three is hosted at the same venue on Monday.
