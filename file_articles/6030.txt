Fascinating mugshots of pick pockets and petty thieves forced to spent Christmas Day behind bars more than 100 years ago capture the desperate poverty that plagued Edwardian Scotland.

The crooks and child criminals, who were locked up in the early 1900s, were convicted of their crimes ranging from 'drunkenness' to 'thievery' and 'burglary' before being sentenced to spend Yuletide in a cold cell.

The Victorians and Edwardians were extremely concerned about crime and after the development of the camera, police realised they could use the new technology to their advantage and took images of repeat offenders.

As cameras became more popular, taking mugshots became the norm until it was made compulsory for everyone to be photographed after they were arrested as well as to show their hands to document tattoos, missiing fingers or any other distinguishing features.

Men, women and children charged with criminal offences were recorded in registers - such as the Fife criminal registers featured- providing an essential tool to law enforcement in tracking those accused of crimes in the area.

These are the remarkable mugshots, which reveal the Edwardian crooks and child criminals who were locked up in jail on Christmas Day over 100 years ago.
