Five-star offensive tackle Broderick Jones won't sign with Georgia this week during the early signing period, according to Rivals.

Jones, the highest-rated offensive player in Georgia's 2020 class, has decided to defer his official commitment until February's National Signing Day and visit both Georgia and Auburn next month, according to the report.

The 6-foot-5, 275-pound lineman made two unofficial visits to Auburn in November. He is from Lithonia, Ga.

Jones committed to Georgia in April 2018.

The 247Sports composite ranks Jones as the nation's No. 2 offensive tackle and the No. 41 player in the nation.

According to the composite, Georgia has the No. 4 recruiting class in the nation, trailing Clemson, Alabama and Ohio State.
