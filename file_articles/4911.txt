A father has been busted riding a motorbike while his son rode on the back carrying an upside-down BMX bike.

The ten-year-old was seen clinging onto the mountain bike with only his hands while his father drove them through Fennell Bay, New South Wales on Tuesday.

After police stopped the pair and told them the bicycle wasn't safely secured, the father replied: 'Yeah he's holding onto it'.
