CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - Authorities in Venezuela said Friday that nine people have died in a plane crash outside the capital of Caracas.

Attorney General Tarek William Saab said that the private plane took off a day earlier from the southern state of Bolivar. It was en route to an airport in Charallave, near the capital.

The pilot and co-pilot were among the passengers killed.

The attorney general said he has assigned two investigators from his office to determine what went wrong.
