Tommy Fury pulled off a stunning victory over Przemyslaw Binienda in just one minute and two seconds on his first fight since starring in TV show Love Island.

The 20-year-old, cheered on by girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague, was relentless from the bell and did not let up at London's Copperbox on the undercard for Daniel Dubois' WBO International and WBC Silver heavyweight fight against Japan's Kyotaro Fujimoto.

The defeat marks a 26th straight professional loss for Binienda and the Polish fighter never looked like overcoming his more powerful rival.

Fury bowled perpetually losing Pole Binienda off his feet twice and finally out on them in just one minute and two seconds.

On, hopefully, to less obliging dance partners in the New Year.

Fury, the brother of former heavyweight champion Tyson, has now won all three of his professional fights inside the distance.

Fury told BT Sport: 'It feels absolutely amazing. Thank you for all these fans who turned out.

'I wasn't looking for a knockout at all, I was going to box to a game plan.

'I would not be here without this man to my left, my dad. It's father and son and we are going to the top.

'This year I have gained a lovely soulmate in Molly and I've ended the year on a big knockout. More of the same in 2020.'
