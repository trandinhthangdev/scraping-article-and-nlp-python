Migrants allowed to live and work in Australia if they invest at least $1.5 million could soon need to spend more money.

The Morrison government is looking at increasing the investment thresholds for business innovation and investment visas, and make changes to where the money must be spent.

Investors are currently required to spend at least $1.5 million up front, which must be held in the country for four years, while those accepted under the "significant investor" stream must spend $5 million.
