Manchester United are targeting another teenage star amid reports that they are tracking Birmingham midfielder Jude Bellingham.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been stepping up his pursuit of Erling Haaland in recent weeks, and it appears he may not be the only young talent on United's radar.

Bellingham has been followed closely this season and Solskjaer's assistant, Mike Phelan, was sent to watch him play against West Brom last weekend, according to The Telegraph.

Manchester United have been linked with a move for Birmingham's Jude Bellingham

United are not alone in eyeing up the 16-year-old, with a number of Premier League rivals and Bundesliga giants also believed to be in the market.

And there were over 10 scouts sent from Germany to watch Bellingham in action against Derby earlier in the campaign.

Bellingham has been a key part of Pep Clotet's side this season, despite his inexperience.

He has started the last 13 games for Birmingham.

In total he has scored two goals in 20 appearances since making his senior debut in August, when he became the club's youngest ever player.
