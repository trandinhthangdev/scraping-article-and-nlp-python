'I can’t remember a word of what I said in my speech because I was crying so much. It was terrible. Even J. J. said, "That was embarrassing!"'

Meanwhile the Murder On The Orient Express star remained cryptic while talking about the new film, as she simply said: 'It’s fair to say it’s my character’s story and it ties everything together.'

'All I can tell you is that it is basically all we love about Star Wars – good versus evil, love and finding the people you choose to be your family,' she added. 'There are lots of laughs and lots of tears. It’s insane that they’ve managed to finish off all nine films.'

Emotional: Of her goodbye speech, Daisy said: 'I can’t remember a word of what I said in my speech because I was crying so much. It was terrible. Even J. J. said, "That was embarrassing!"

Earlier this month, Daisy's co-star John Boyega joked about her speech, as he said during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon that it was 'absolute nonsense.'

Revealing how he made sure they finished together, he said: 'I actually wrapped two shots before Daisy, me and Naomi Ackie had a pick up shot to do and then daisy had her scene, and I waited so me and daisy wrapped together.'

He then jokingly added: 'I said a gorgeous speech, it was absolutely amazing everybody was in tears, however Daisy's speech was absolute nonsense.

'She cried throughout the whole thing, we didn't understand what she was saying but it was emotional nonetheless.'
