Perth Scorchers captain Mitch Marsh has won the toss and elected to bowl first in the BBL match against the Strikers at Adelaide Oval.

The Scorchers are fielding an unchanged line-up after beating the Melbourne Renegades by 11 runs at Perth Stadium on Saturday.

Marsh earned man-of-the-match honours in that victory, hitting an unbeaten 56 off just 22 balls - including six sixes - and will be eager to continue his cracking start to the tournament.

The Strikers are seeking their maiden win of the season after their first match was abandoned in the fifth over of Sydney Thunder's run chase last Saturday as bushfire smoke blanketed Manuka Oval.

Veteran seamer Peter Siddle, who was treated for smoke inhalation after the match, has joined Australia's Test squad in Melbourne ahead of the Boxing Day Test against New Zealand.

Siddle has been replaced by off-season recruit Harry Conway, who will be making his first appearance in Strikers colours.

Adelaide Strikers: Alex Carey (capt), Wes Agar, Harry Conway, Rashid Khan, Phil Salt, Matt Short, Billy Stanlake, Cameron Valente, Jake Weatherald, Jon Wells, Cameron White.

Perth Scorchers: Mitchell Marsh (capt), Ashton Agar, Fawad Ahmed, Cameron Bancroft, Cameron Green, Josh Inglis, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Joel Paris, Jhye Richardson, Ashton Turner.
