Chris Smalling could return to action for Roma on Friday after resuming training following a knee injury.

The English defender, on-loan from Manchester United for the season, missed Roma's last two games with the problem.

But on Thursday he was back in action on the training ground and could return as soon as Friday for the Serie A clash against Fiorentina, according to Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport.

Chris Smalling is in line to make his return for Roma on Friday following a short spell out

Smalling has been impressive during his time in Italy, making 11 Serie A appearances so far and keeping five clean sheets in defence.

His good form saw England manager Gareth Southgate travel to watch the 30-year-old against Inter Milan two weeks ago, where he was up against former United team-mate Romelu Lukaku.

Smalling has 31 caps for England, but has not made a national team squad since November 2017.
