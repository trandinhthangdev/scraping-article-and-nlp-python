Carolina Panthers rookie quarterback Will Grier will get the starting nod and make his NFL regular-season debut against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, interim head coach Perry Fewell announced Thursday.

He is replacing Kyle Allen, whose recent inefficiency as a starter after Cam Newton's foot injury has led to a six-game losing streak and cries for a replacement. Allen has been practicing with the scout team this week.

Grier, the Panthers' third-round selection in the 2019 draft out of West Virginia, has not appeared in a regular-season NFL game. The 24-year-old finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting in 2018 after throwing for 3,864 yards, 37 touchdowns and eight interceptions for the Mountaineers.

He will be the ninth rookie quarterback to start a game this season, according to the Charlotte Observer.

Allen guided the Panthers to four consecutive victories without throwing an interception from Weeks 3-6, but has struggled since then.

The 23-year-old Houston product has thrown for 3,027 yards this season with 17 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, including 11 picks during the team's losing streak. The Panthers (5-9) are tied for last in the NFC South with the Atlanta Falcons.
