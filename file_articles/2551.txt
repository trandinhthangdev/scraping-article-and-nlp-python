“Local residents may notice an increased police presence in the area as we conduct further enquiries and we are appealing to anyone with information or dashcam footage that can assist us to please get in touch.”

At around the same time, GMP officers were called to a collision to the M66 near Bury after a pedestrian was killed after being hit by multiple vehicles.

He was hit by further vehicles on the southbound carriageway.
