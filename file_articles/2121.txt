Brady Manek scored 13 points and had 10 rebounds, hitting a key 3-pointer in the final two minutes, to help lift Oklahoma to a 53-52 home win over Central Florida on Saturday.

While Manek was the leading scorer, Kristian Doolittle and Kur Kuath came up with several critical plays down the stretch to help the Sooners come back for the win.

Doolittle had 12 points and eight rebounds. Kuath had just five points and two blocks but both his offensive and defensive contributions came at critical times in the second half.

Oklahoma never led until less than 12 minutes remained, when De'Vion Harmon -- who came off the bench for the first time this season -- knocked down a 3-pointer to put the Sooners up 41-40.

The Golden Knights (9-3) led by as many as 12 late in the first half before the Sooners (8-3) started chipping away.

UCF didn't get to the free-throw line in the second half until less than two minutes remained in the game.

That was a difference from the first half, when it was Oklahoma that struggled to make it to the line. The Sooners didn't attempt a free throw in the first half.

The Golden Knights went more than four minutes without hitting a field goal -- missing 10 consecutive shots -- until Dre Fuller Jr. hit a corner 3-pointer with 1:07 remaining.

Fuller had a chance to be the hero at the end, but his 3-point attempt -- from nearly the same spot on the floor as his earlier make -- hit the rim and bounced away to give the Sooners the win.

That came after Collin Smith grabbed a rebound on the other end with eight seconds left. The Knights had a time out remaining but Johnny Dawkins instead let his team play for a game-winning shot.

Oklahoma snapped a two-game losing streak and snapped UCF's six-game winning streak.

Fuller led the Knights with 13 points.

UCF shot just 31.3 percent, its lowest percentage so far this season. The 52 points were also a season low for the Knights.

Oklahoma prevailed despite shooting 32.3 percent.
