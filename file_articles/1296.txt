Taking time out of work to have children can play havoc with women's pension saving - and it can take many years to claw back lost gains.

Many ideas have been floated to try to tackle this issue and improve mothers' pensions, but none have got off the ground so far.

Meanwhile, more people are opting to switch to flexible self-employment, or even jacking it all in for a while and jet off for a year travelling the world.

This is Money's knowledge and product editor Sarah Davidson is hosting a new podcast series alongside Fidelity International's Maike Currie, where they talk about money, life and the financial decisions women face. On this first episode, they talk career breaks and maternity leave.

Have you ever dreamed of jacking it all in and jetting off for a year travelling the world?

According to website thecareerbreaksite.com around 90,000 people in the UK take a career break every year.

Taking a break from the routine of 9am to 5pm five days a week can be great for your mental wellbeing, personal development and even your confidence.

But what about the impact it has on your finances? And your career?

Sarah and Maike's first guest is Rebecca Jones, freelance journalist and veteran career breaker.

In this episode, they find out how she paid off her debts while travelling the world and what happened when she got back.

They also cover the impact that taking a break can have on saving for your retirement, how to manage maternity leave and more.
