The clip first starts out with the child attempting to climb into her lap while she played the game.

She then appears to shove and slap the child while yelling: 'Let go!'

About four hours into her livestream, the mother appears to bit the child's arm, but the footage isn't completely clear.

The mother then roughly picks the child up before throwing the crying infant back on the bed.

According to Metro, the woman was arrested at her home and charged on Wednesday.

A man and two other children were also at the home when police arrived.

Police said they are taking a closer look at the video for more evidence. The investigation is ongoing.

Authorities said it is likely that the woman 'that more charges are going to be laid as we go deeper into the investigation'.
