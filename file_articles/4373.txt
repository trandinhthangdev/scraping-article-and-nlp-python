Interest is hotting up across Europe in Bayer Leverkusen's 20-year-old star Kai Havertz

Leverkusen have reportedly slapped a £111million price tag on Havertz, who is one of the hottest prospects in Germany.

Haverz has scored 31 goals in 121 games since bursting onto the scene as a 17-year-old at the BayArena.

He has earned seven senior caps for the national side under Joachim Low and scored his first goal for his country in a friendly against Argentina in October.
