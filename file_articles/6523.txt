At least eight children have been rescued from hot cars in one state alone as temperatures hit 40C.

Emergency crews were called to eight vehicles on Thursday to rescue young children locked inside.

One report was in Barwon in the state's south-west and the others were in metropolitan areas.

The mercury hit 41C in Melbourne's surrounds, including in Bendigo, Seymour and Hopetoun.

Ambulance Victoria said in a statement that none of the children needed treatment.

They also warned people not to leave infants or pets in cars.

Friday will be Melbourne's hottest day with a high of 44C.

WHAT HAPPENS TO A CHILD IN A HOT CAR Seven minutes: The child starts sweating and becomes uncomfortable. Ten minutes: The child can have a seizure carrying the risk of serious injury and brain damage. 20 minutes: High risk of death.

The rescues come after a spate of fatal hot car incidents.

Dr Dilip Dhupelia, the president of the Australian Medical Association's Queensland branch, previously told Daily Mail Australia: 'It is never OK to leave a child in the car.'

'Children's bodies heat up three to five times faster than adults do, and the younger the child, the more vulnerable they are.

'Winding down the windows or parking in the shade will do little.

'Some people have this false sense of protection - "it's only 10 minutes, I'll leave the window open four or five centimetres".

'It doesn't stop the temperature rising.'

The doctor said the mercury can rise so fast in 10 minutes in the car that heatstroke and seizures can occur.
