Boris Johnson is being urged to launch an emergency response unit to protect vulnerable regions from 'catastrophic' damage following the latest weather misery to hit the UK.

Rain and floods have brought fresh chaos to Britain over the weekend with rivers bursting their banks in the south of England and Christmas travel plans thrown into doubt on the shortest day of the year.

Caravan dwellers had to be ferried away from their flooded park in Yalding, Kent, yesterday after the River Medway burst its banks following a second night of heavy rain.

Nearly 100 properties have been flooded from Kent to Cornwall and there are 88 immediate flood warnings from Middlesbrough down to the south coast.

There was also disruption to rail services, with at least one train from Paddington delayed on its way to Cornwall after it was hit by several waves along the sea wall in Devon.

The latest downpours prompted calls for the Prime Minister to act urgently, with Dan Jarvis, the mayor of the Sheffield city region, urging him to set up a 'Cobra for the north' to swing into action when floods hit.

It came after Mr Johnson was criticised for his response to the weekend weather woes.

Simon Greaves , the leader of Bassetlaw council, where almost 200 homes were damaged, said: 'There will be a need for multi- million -pound investment for flood defences without any doubt if we're going to avoid a catastrophe of the same scale.'

Flood warnings are likely to remain in place until Christmas Eve, but the day itself is expected to see cold and dry weather with temperatures dropping to 23F (-5C), meaning a White Christmas is unlikely.

There are 88 flood warnings in place and a further 227 flooding alerts yesterday, meaning there is a risk of flash flooding and standing water.

With more rain likely on Monday and Tuesday, the flood threat is expected continue for the next few days in southern and central England, according to the Environment Agency.

Drivers face queues of more than an hour and a half between Flitwick and Daventry yesterday, with hour-long traffic jams expected on the M25 clockwise between the junctions for the M23 and M40.

The RAC says 2.5million leisure trips are expected on the roads yesterday with another 6.2million preparing to get away before Christmas Day.

The organisation has warned motorists to expect 'bumper-to-bumper' traffic over the next few days, with 31.2 million journeys set to be taken in the week before Christmas.

Data from transport specialists INRIX shows the M1 in Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire, the northern and western sections of the clockwise M25, and M6 in the West Midlands are expected to see the worst delays over the next week.

Emergency services in Buckinghamshire had to rescue a mother and her three young sons who became stuck in their car in flood water in Edgecott overnight.

Thames Valley Police urged drivers not to move or ignore 'road closed' signs placed on the routes most at risk of flooding.

Ben Aldous, of the RAC, said 'bumper-to-bumper traffic on some motorways and major A-roads' was 'near-guaranteed'.

He said: 'It looks as though millions of drivers are planning to complete their Christmas getaway trips this week.

'Unfortunately, when you add in the prospect of unsettled weather, with heavy rain and strong winds in some parts, these are likely to be pretty unpleasant drives.'

Yesterday was also the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. In London, the sun rose at 8.05am and set at 3.54pm for a total of seven hours and 49 minutes of daylight.

The hours were more extreme in Scotland: in Inverness, the sun rose at 8.58am and set at 3.33pm. From now on, the days will start getting gradually longer again.

Yesterday there was flooding at Blackwater station in Hampshire, forcing rail travellers to take replacement buses until the line towards Reading re-opened.

Great Northern, Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Southern rail services were all disrupted into Sunday morning.

Later, passengers faced delays on a Great Western Railway service from Paddington to Penzance after the train was hit by waves as it travelled along the sea wall near Newton Abbot in Devon.

There were also urgent track repairs needed on the Midland Main Line at Kentish Town, although it was unclear if these were related to the weather.

At the caravan park in Kent, residents of 115 mobile homes were evacuated by motorboat after the River Medway burst its banks on Saturday.

Yesterday people were seen paddling down footpaths which had turned to canals, after fire crews used inflatable boats to reach the residents who were most at risk.

Kent Fire and Rescue Service says the caravan park is likely to be cut off for at least the next few days before the water subsides.

Meteorologist Steven Keates said on Sunday afternoon: 'Yesterday's rain is slowly clearing in eastern England - it's fairly light and patchy now, there's not really too much falling but it's totted up the rainfall and the flooding issues across the south overnight.'

'The good news is that the next couple of days offer a bit of a respite.

'There's a bit of rain in the forecast mostly in the form of showers but the rainfall amounts in areas affected by flooding in recent days will be relatively small and won't greatly exacerbate the problem.'

But as groundwater levels across parts of the south are still very high, there are likely to be ongoing flood issues in the region.

Mr Keates added: 'There is still some rain in the forecast but on the whole it's not looking as wet as it has in the last few days which I think for most people is good news.'

Environment Agency flood defences have been installed in Leatherhead, Surrey after fears that the river Mole would flood parts of the high street and surrounding houses. River levels remain high after heavy overnight rain in the south

Flood warnings and alerts are expected to remain in place until at least Christmas Eve until rain starts to clear the South on Christmas Day.

December 25 itself will see lows of 23F (-5C) in Scotland and 27F (-3C) in the South of England, with possible ice and frost but mainly dry skies.

Sunny spells follow later on Christmas Day – good news for families planning to walk off a turkey lunch.

Forecaster Marco Petagna said: 'There's potential for further transport disruption, with flood warnings and alerts, rain at times on Monday affecting much of England and Wales and rain at times on Christmas Eve in the Midlands and South.

'Allow extra time for journeys, watch out for standing water and do not drive through flood water.

'We don't expect a white Christmas as Christmas Day looks dry – but colder than now, with a north-westerly flow coming in on Christmas Eve, and high pressure.

'Ice patches and frost are certainly possible in the South and North, but most should have sunny spells afterwards for a walk after the turkey.

'Wet and windy weather is likely on Boxing Day and Friday, with more unsettled weather on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, especially in the North and West, with a changeable start to the new year.'

The Environment Agency said: 'Local flooding is possible more widely at times until Tuesday across the South and Midlands. Properties could flood and there could be travel disruption.'

Drivers who break down in unknown places can find out where they are Drivers with the AA who break down in unknown locations will now be able to find out where they are within a 3m x 3m (10ft x 10ft) square. A company called what3words has divided the world into 3m x 3m squares, and assigned each one a three word identifier. This means that AA customers can now provide the call operator with their exact what3words address during a breakdown to help find them faster. The AA estimates there could be up to 143 million car journeys over this Christmas period, with around 10,000 breakdowns per day. what3words does not require an internet connection, so even if a customer breaks down in a very rural location with no visible landmarks, they will be able to find and describe the exact position of their stranded vehicle.
