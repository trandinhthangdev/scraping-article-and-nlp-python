LSU standout running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire missed practice Wednesday due to a hamstring injury, and his status for the Dec. 28 College Football Playoff semifinal against Oklahoma is uncertain.

Edwards-Helaire suffered the injury on Tuesday in a non-contact situation, Tigers coach Ed Orgeron told reporters on Wednesday.

Orgeron said he didn't yet know the extent of the injury and that Edwards-Helaire was still undergoing tests.

"I'm not sure that Clyde can't play or can play yet," Orgeron said. .".. We're going to know more by the end of the week."

Not having Edwards-Helaire would be a big blow for the No. 1 Tigers (13-0), who play No. 4 Oklahoma (12-1) in the semi in Atlanta that doubles as the Peach Bowl.

Edwards-Helaire, a junior, was a first-team All-SEC selection this season after rushing for 1,290 yards and 16 touchdowns. He also caught 50 passes for 399 yards and one score.

Senior quarterback Joe Burrow is LSU's second-leading rusher with 289 yards. Freshman running back Tyrion Davis-Price is third with 270 yards and six rushing scores.

Edwards-Helaire registered six 100-yard rushing games this season, including a season-best 188 on just six carries against Arkansas.
