A cool change has snapped South Australia's four-day heatwave but not before the string of 40C plus days resulted in hundreds of ambulance call-outs.

The Ambulance Service said it has responded to 489 heat-related incidents by Friday afternoon with 315 resulting in people being taken to hospital.

However, health authorities said there were yet to see any reports of heat-related deaths.

After a top temperature of 45.3C on Thursday, Adelaide's maximum on Friday surged to 43.9C as the change began to move through, leaving it short of the 46C forecast.

The city is expected to have a much milder top of 25C on Saturday.

A number of regional centres had their hottest December days on record on Friday including Woomera with 48.1C, Coober Pedy 48.2C, Mount Gambier 45.9 and Keith with 49.2C.
