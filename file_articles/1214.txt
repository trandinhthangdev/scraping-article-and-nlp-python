Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho is hoping that Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen will sign new contracts with the club.

Both Eriksen and Vertonghen are out of contract in the summer but the Spurs boss is hoping they will put pen to paper and follow their team-mate Toby Alderweireld, who signed a new deal earlier this week.

Speaking with Sky Sports, Mourinho explained that Eriksen and Vertonghen have been through a lot with the club and have a great relationship with the fans.

Jose Mourinho has urged Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen to sign new contracts at Spurs

Both players are out of contract in the summer and could leave as early as January

'Christian has been here such a long time,' said the Tottenham boss.

'If I was Jan (Vertonghen) or Christian (Eriksen), I would stay. They have been living the life of the club for the last five or six years. The transition from White Hart Lane to the best stadium in the world and knows the perspectives of the future and the vision of the club.'

He added: 'When I arrived, we potentially had three top players leaving, now we have two potentially.'

Eriksen has attracted interest from Serie A's Juventus and La Liga's Real Madrid

Whether it will be zero, one or two I cannot tell you.

'I am happy it is not three now. I read a quote of Toby's that said 'There is no place I could be happier than this' and it helps that since I have arrived he has played every minute of every match.'

Eriksen, the more valuable of the two players, has attracted interest from Juventus and Real Madrid but has kept his cards close to his chest in terms of a January move.
