Almost a billion dollars will be wasted on Christmas gifts this year, a survey has found.

More than seven million Australians say they don't expect to use some of the Christmas gifts they receive this year, representing an estimated $980 million, a survey by The Australia Institute has found.

"Christmas is a time for giving, but almost half of Australians would prefer that others do not buy them Christmas presents," deputy director Ebony Bennett said in a statement on Monday.

The survey of 1424 Australians found 74 per cent of people like buying Christmas gifts, but 48 per cent would prefer others don't buy them presents.

"Many of us expect to get presents we'll never use or wear and two-thirds of Australians think buying unwanted presents is not a good way to boost the economy," Ms Bennett said.

"The holidays don't have to be about buying the biggest, most expensive gifts on the shelf because, as Mum always said, 'it's the thought that counts'."
