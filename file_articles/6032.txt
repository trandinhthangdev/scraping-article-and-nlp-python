Harry Kane showed he is in festive spirit by diving into snow on a family break to Lapland during a rare break from Tottenham training.

The England captain whisked his family away to Rovaniemi in Finland as Tottenham did not have a midweek game due to their early elimination from the Carabao Cup.

Jose Mourinho handed his stars time away from the club as they enjoyed some downtime with their family ahead of the busy Christmas period.

Kane posted a video of himself jumping into the snow and then into a hot tub alongside the caption: 'New recovery technique'.

Daughters Ivy, two, and Vivienne, one, joined Kane and wife Kate as they jetted away for a midweek break.

Manager Mourinho will be hoping his star striker is revitalised ahead of their Premier League showdown with his former side Chelsea.

Spurs will move ahead of the Blues into fourth spot if they can beat their London rivals at home on Sunday afternoon.

The clash will see Frank Lampard and Mourinho go head-to-head as opposing coaches for the first time in the Premier League.

Lampard got the better of Mourinho's Manchester United last season when Derby eliminated the Red Devils from the League Cup on penalties.
