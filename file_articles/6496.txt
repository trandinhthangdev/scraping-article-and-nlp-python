Vodafone customers have slammed the telco company for charging them twice and taking money out of their accounts without their permission.

A week out from Christmas, 30,000 Australian customers have been left fuming as money went missing from their accounts due to the 'banking glitch'.

The telecommunications company acknowledged there was an error in payments and have apologised to customers who have been affected.

'Unfortunately as a result of a banking error your payment made in November 2019 was not taken from your bank account and given to Vodafone,' the statement read.

'The payment did reflect on your Vodafone account.

'The error was corrected and the payment has now been transferred to Vodafone.

'We are sorry for this delay.'

Customers took to Vodafone's Facebook page calling out the telco provider for their error and not taking steps to prevent it from occurring.

'You guys are shocking. How dare you take 2 months to tell me that my phone bill had not been paid when infact it had been with proof from my bank,' one wrote.

'How dare you take $200 within 3 hours of being on the phone.'

'Absolute crap to do this to families a week before Xmas,' another wrote.

'Vodafone Australia, this is not good enough!!! You took a payment out of my account and then notified me 4 hours later that you did it,' someone else commented.

One person said this is a 'common occurrence' with Vodafone customers who use direct debit.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Vodafone for comment.
