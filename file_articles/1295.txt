Every week we give the low-down on the value of forgotten treasures that may be gathering dust at home.

Board games are dusted off at this time of year for dice-throwing family feuds over sets that themselves can be worth good money.

Monopoly has stood the test of time, with pre-war sets in good condition worth more than £100. Even sets made up to the 1960s that came in distinctive black boxes change hands for £50.

Cluedo is another big favourite at Christmas. If you have a 1949 first edition – recognisable by a red fingerprint under a magnifying glass on the cover – you have tracked down a £150 find.

A nostalgic favourite no longer made is horse racing game Escalado. This came out in 1928, and an early example with lead weights is worth at least £200. Later metal examples can fetch £100 – but plastic sets from the 1990s are worthless.

Limited edition fantasy role-play games can fetch top prices among collectors. Only 1,500 copies of a special 2010 edition of War Of The Ring, based on JRR Tolkien’s novels, were ever made.

New, they sold for £300. Now they can go for £3,000.
