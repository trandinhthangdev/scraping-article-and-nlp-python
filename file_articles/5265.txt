RB Le'Veon Bell faces former team for first time since leaving Steelers in offseason and signing with New York. Bell, three-time Pro Bowl selection with Steelers, sat out all last season in contract dispute with Pittsburgh. He ran for season-high 87 yards last week at Baltimore, but 3.3 rushing average is lowest of career. ... QB Sam Darnold has thrown two TD passes in each of last two games.

PR Braxton Berrios leads all qualified punt returners (minimum of 1.25 returns per game) with 11.1 average, including 12 returns of at least 10 yards. ... Fantasy tip: Bell is tempting play against Steelers, but hasn't scored in his last three games. Anderson could be safest play in matchup as he has re-established himself as go-to guy for Darnold.
