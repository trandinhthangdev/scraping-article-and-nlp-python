YouTuber Logan Paul has responded to rumours he has appeared in a leaked gay sex tape.

The internet personality, 24, poked fun at the existence of the video which shows someone with a likeness to Paul performing oral sex on another man.

Many have cast doubts on the identity of the man in the video, but that did not stop Paul tweeting to his 5.2million followers: '100k retweets and ill release the full sex tape.'

In a series of tweets, he joked about the existence of the tape without confirming or denying it was him

The tweet, posted five hours ago, has already attracted nearly 20,000 retweets.

He is still yet to confirm or deny if the man in the video is him.

The entertainer also goaded fellow YouTuber James Charles, an openly gay star who found fame with his makeup tutorials.

Paul, whose boxing match with British YouTuber KSI was promoted as 'the biggest internet event in history', wrote on Twitter: 'James Charles ur next.'

But Charles then responded, mocking the rumoured video and Paul's now questioned sexuality by saying: 'Sorry bro I only go for straight guys.'

In a final tweet, Paul said: 'When click bait turns to d*** bait.'

Logan Paul is reportedly single having split from actress Chloe Bennet in October 2018.

He has previously had to defend himself from criticism from the LGBT community.

He joked about going gay for a month which led many to lambast him for suggesting being gay was a choice.

The star was also involved in a major controversy after posting a video of the corpse of a man who had recently committed suicide in a forest in Japan.
