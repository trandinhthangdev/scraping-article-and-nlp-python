Video footage showed how a 44C heatwave caused chocolates to melt to a liquid while sitting on supermarket shelves.

An Instagram account with a humorous take on goings-on in Adelaide posted the video on Friday with the sarcastic caption: 'Warning: distressing content. Please consider all the victims who lose air conditioning in this extreme heat.'

The footage showed a woman filming her hand as she pressed and squeezed a row of supermarket chocolate blocks, revealing how melted they were.

The video also panned up to another woman who showed the harsh effects of the heatwave when she shook and bent a Dairy Milk block.

The text on the video revealed the reason why these sweet treats were no longer solid and said: 'No aircon, no worries.'

Viewers had mixed opinions on the melted confectionery as some were horrified but others didn't seem to mind.

One commenter was appalled to see the chocolate in such a state and said: 'That’s awful. I can’t watch it.'

Another chocolate-lover was not deterred and said: 'I’d still eat it'

One commenter merely suggested a simple solution with the one-word response: 'Fondue??'

The melted moment came amidst a nationwide heatwave as Australia experienced its hottest day ever recorded on Tuesday.

Southern and central Australia also experienced temperatures of up to 16C above average on Friday.
