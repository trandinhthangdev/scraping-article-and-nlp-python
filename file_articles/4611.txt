Thousands of people in drought-ravaged regions are signing up for the Newstart unemployment allowance.

The number of Newstart recipients in the 127 drought-declared local government areas has soared by almost 4000 since 2015.

More than 3200 people have signed onto the jobless benefit in the past 12 months alone.

There are now more than 57,200 Newstart recipients in drought-affected areas, according to answers to questions on notice submitted by Labor senators.

Labor's social services spokeswoman Linda Burney said the increase in drought-stricken regions came at the same time the Morrison government was touting an overall decrease in Newstart recipients.

"It's clear that our regions are bearing the brunt," Ms Burney said on Friday.

"An increase to Newstart would benefit our regions the most."

The government has long resisted widespread calls to raise the $40-a-day dole.

But several state and federal coalition MPs, including the NSW deputy premier, have argued raising the payment would stimulate regional economies during the drought.
