A businessmanhas been banned from being a company director for seven years after his firm made 21m nuisance calls.

Jason Gambling, of Basingstoke, Hampshire, was banned by the Insolvency Service after complaints that his telecoms consultancy firm The Legend Alliance Ltd had made unwelcome calls between February and May 2016.

The business was investigated by the Information Commissioners Office.

It made 21m unsolicited marketing calls in four months – 175,000 a day.

It went into voluntary liquidation owing almost £200,000 in debt in February 2017.

The ICO referred Gambling, 48, to the Insolvency Service and he was disqualified last month.
