Australia could eclipse its record for the hottest day in history for the third consecutive day as the searing heatwave and 100km/h winds fuel one of the nation's worst ever bushfire crises.

Melbourne is forecast to nudge 44C on Friday, while temperatures in Adelaide are predicted to reach 46C - toppling the record set on Thursday for the city's hottest December day.

Sydney will see a brief relief in temperatures after hitting 45C in the far west but then soar back up to 42C on Saturday as the wall of heat hovering over Australia continues to send records tumbling.

The soaring heat could mean Friday's national average maximum temperature is even higher than Tuesday's record-breaking 40.7C and Wednesday's 41.9C.

The NSW bushfire crisis turned deadly on Thursday night, when two volunteer firefighters from the Hawsley Park brigade in western Sydney were killed after their RFS truck crashed into a fallen tree and rolled.

Paramedics rushed to Wilson Drive in Buxton, 150km south-west of Sydney, just before 11.30pm on Thursday when the crash happened as firefighters battled the Green Wattle Creek blaze.

Both the driver and the front passenger died at the scene, while three other firefighters were injured and treated by paramedics.

NSW RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers said the Hawsley Park brigade were a 'pretty tight-knit group'.

'Our thoughts are with the families and the firefighters and unfortunately we still have a lot of fires to deal with,' he added. 'We'll be turning our minds to that today and maintaining the support for the families.'

Thursday's average temperature is yet to be analysed, but could also reach record-breaking levels when its results are announced on Friday.

'It is possible that record … may continue to be broken for the next couple of days,' Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Kimba Wong told The Courier Mail.

Firefighters are bracing for a disastrous end to the week, with the New South Wales Southern Highlands region already reeling from the loss of at least 40 homes to the Green Wattle Creek Fire, which continues to burn out of control.

The blaze, 150km south-west of Sydney, as well as the Gospers Mountain mega fire, are both burning at an emergency warning level - while more than 100 other fires burn across the state.

But Queensland's Fire and Emergency Service have warned they will be in no position to send in reinforcements to their southern neighbours as they too face worsening bushfire conditions in the surging heat.

A severe fire warning has been issued for the Darling Downs and Granite Belt, the Central Highlands and Coalfields for Friday and Sunday while the rest of the state remains at high and very high danger levels.

The potentially record-breaking day could see Melbourne tip 44C on the thermostat on Friday, while the temperature in Adelaide has been predicted to reach 46C

The record-breaking temperatures in South Australia could also lead to catastrophic fire conditions, the state's fire chiefs have warned.

'If fires break out in these conditions, they will be dangerous and fast-moving,' the deputy chief officer of the South Australian Country Fire Service Andrew Stark told The Adelaide Advertiser.

'They are the kind of conditions which are dangerous for our firefighters and could see properties and sometimes lives lost.

'If we have widespread lightning, there will be more fires than our aircraft can handle.'

Nullarbor broke the record for the hottest-ever December day when it hit 49.9C on Thursday afternoon, while Ceduna on the Eyre Peninsula recorded its hottest day in more than 80 years at 48.8C.

The 48C-plus heat in Port Augusta was so extreme this week the city's council said four of its roads were already showing 'signs of bleeding' as the bitumen began to melt under the searing temperatures.

Firefighters in the Blue Mountains are meanwhile desperately battling to contain a blaze - which on Friday crossed the Bells Line of Road - burning near the outskirts of the town of Bilpin

The 46C forecast in Melbourne would mean the city could sweat through its hottest day since Black Saturday in 2009, when the temperature reached 46.4C.

Melbourne Yarra Trams has also advised that services will be altered on Friday to cater for the heat, given the potential for significant disruptions to services.

Emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp asked Victorians to be bushfire ready.

'If you leave when you see the fires, it might be too late,' Mr Crisp said.

'It will be a tough and challenging day for the state. We're doing everything we can, what are you doing?'

Forty fires have been burning across Victoria this week, with more than 50,000 hectares of land scorched by four fires in Gippsland in the past month.

A front moving across Western Australia is expected to bring an end in sight to this week's heatwave by this weekend, with the cool change arriving in NSW in time for Christmas.

The RFS expressed their devastation after losing two brave volunteer firefighters on Thursday night.

'The Service's thoughts are with all the firefighter's family, friends and fellow brigade members,' it said in a statement.

'This is an absolutely devastating event in what has already been an incredibly difficult day and fire season.'

Other firefighters were severely burned as they battled the Gospers Mountain fire in the Blue Mountains, which are edging closer to Sydney.

NSW RFS captain Jon Russell said he thought he was going to die as his crew were trapped in their melting fire truck by a sharp change in wind direction.

'As I got out of the driver's seat, they came back screaming ''Get back in the truck get back in the truck'',' he said told The Daily Telegraph.

'We stuck hard up against the garage because it was the only thing I could see… it was unbelievable the speed that moved at. Of all the days I have been a firefighter, today is the only day I thought it would be my last.'

A property was flattened in Buxton, 150 kilometres southwest of Sydney as residents were told it was too late to leave

Balmoral - home to about 700 people in the New South Wales Southern Highlands - and several other tiny towns were ravaged by the 149,000 hectare megafire early on Thursday afternoon.

Two firefighters had to be placed in induced comas after being overrun by flames at Bargo, while another three were injured.

A 56-year-old man suffering burns to his face and legs and a 28-year-old woman with burns to her face both had to be airlifted to Concord Hospital in 'serious conditions'.

The devastating blazes have prompted NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian to declare a state of emergency for the next seven days and urged any travellers to reassess their holiday plans.

'As bad as conditions are today, Saturday is going to be worse,' NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Thursday afternoon.

'If you are told a road is closed, if you are told not to travel please take the advice, this is a state of emergency, we don't take it lightly.

'It's normally a special time of the year, but we are under extreme circumstance and we just need everybody to listen to the warnings.'

The Bureau of Meteorology said the worst is still yet to come with a slight relief in temperatures on Friday before an 'exceptionally hot air mass' blasts New South Wales on Saturday.

'Saturday has the potential to be a very challenging day for NSW and ACT residents, with ­severe to extreme heatwave conditions, deteriorating air quality and gusty wind changes which will lead to dangerous fire con­ditions,' meteorologist Andre Peace told The Daily Telegraph.

In Balmoral and the neighbouring town of Bargo, authorities said 20 homes have been destroyed, while another 20 were lost in Buxton.

One woman who was loading horses into a float as she fled Bargo - where at least six homes have been lost - said both her animals and residents of the town were 'in panic mode'.

'Property can be saved but it's life that can,' she told 9News.

Even more crushing for the firefighters battling to keep the bushfires under control was the fact many of them lost their own homes to the blazes.

A ball of flamed consumed this home in Buxton, which neighbours fire-ravaged Balmoral in NSW's Southern Highlands,

'They're absolutely shattered - they are devastated by loss but it goes that little further when it's your own home or the colleague you've got sitting on the fire truck next to you,' NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told the Illawarra Mercury.

Adding to the headaches for fire fighters was a southerly change on Thursday which pushed the blaze towards southern Sydney suburbs including Tahmoor.

Residents in Tahmoor, Pheasants Nest, Buxton, Couridjah, Thirlmere, Bargo, Balmoral and Yanderra were told it was too late to leave.

The mayor of Wollondilly Shire Matthew Deeth said the situation was 'as serious as it gets'.

Two major fire fronts have converged in Balmoral - which have been fanned by the winds exceeding 100 km/h

'Our evacuation centre at Picton Bowling Club is at capacity and our RFS volunteers are stretched incredibly thin,' he told The Australian.

300 people were on Thursday night sheltering inside RSL clubs at Piction and nearby Mittagong.

One resident said they were shocked the fire had reached suburbia - with the collection of small towns less than 50km away from Campbelltown on Sydney's south-western fringe.

By 7pm on Thursday evening, the state's Rural Fire Service extended the same warning to the towns of Newnes Junction, Dargan and Clarence in the Blue Mountains.

Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told media the fire was growing at such a rapid rate that it was currently hard to get exact details on properties lost.

'I suspect we're probably talking in the vicinity of dozens. What that is in terms of homes, sheds, facilities, I just simply don't have that detail at this stage,' he said.

'It's too fast and unfolding as we speak.'

Up to 40 homes have been lost and several firefighters rushed to hospital suffering severe burns

'We just do not have the capacity to send people to help at the moment,' a Queensland Fire and Emergency Service spokesman said.

'In fact, we may have to seek help from other states if conditions worsen in Queensland.'

Conditions are also worsening at Currowan, on the NSW South Coast, where at 3pm a fire was upgraded to watch and act stage.

Earlier on Thursday, Ms Berejiklian declared a state of emergency, as temperatures in Sydney's far west hit 45C and 39C in Sydney's CBD.

There are concerns the Gospers Mountain fire, ravaging the northern end of the Blue Mountains National Park, could meet the Green Wattle Creek blaze to the south.

Firefighters battled in vain to stop the fire from jumping the Bells Line of Road at Berambing - which runs east to west through the national park.

'It roared over the road, destroying power lines and cutting the various Fire Brigade resources in half stuck on either side of the fire,' The Sydney Morning Herald reported from the scene.

The Blue Mountains train line has been closed in its outer-western stretch between Lithgow and Mount Victoria as a fire threatens the rail corridor in between the two stations at Bell.

Those in the town of Bilpin, meanwhile, are bracing for the fire to reach their homes.

During a press conference, the NSW Premier said the 'decision to declare a state of emergency is not taken lightly.

'You only declare states of emergency when it's absolutely necessary and on expert advice from commissioners,' Ms Berejiklian said.

It is the second state of emergency she has declared since the start of this year's horror bushfire season. Six people have died and more than 800 homes have been lost.

Ms Berejiklian said they weren't expecting conditions to be as catastrophic as they were during the previous state of emergency on November 11.

Prior to the November 11 declaration, NSW had not faced a state of emergency since October 2013.

The announcement relinquishes decision making powers from the NSW government and allows Commissioner Fitzsimmons more control over his team of firefighters.

For the next seven days during the state of emergency, he has the ability to control and coordinate the allocation of government resources, close roads and evacuate residents.

This marks just the fifth state of emergency declared since 2006.

The floods in 2012, both in Queensland and NSW, warranted an emergency warning, as did bushfires in October 2013.

Other natural disasters, including the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009, didn't result in an emergency warning.

What does a state of emergency mean? Declaring a state of emergency relinquishes decision making powers from the NSW government and allows RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons more control over his team of firefighters. For the next seven days during the state of emergency, can now control and coordinate the allocation of government resources, close roads and evacuate residents. Ms Fitzsimmons now has the ability to: Control and coordinate the allocation of government resources Evacuate people from property within declared areas Close roads and thoroughfares to traffic Pull down or shore up infrastructure at risk of collapse Shut down utilities in the declared area including electricity, gas, oil and water Enter or take possession of property for emergency response NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian held a press conference held on Thursday morning, where she said the 'decision to declare a state of emergency is not taken lightly. 'You only declare states of emergency when it's absolutely necessary and on expert advice from commissioners.' It is the second state of emergency she has declared since the start of this year's horror bushfire season, which has seen six people die and more than 800 homes lost. Ms Berejiklian said they weren't expecting conditions to be as catastrophic as they were during the previous state of emergency.

An extreme fire danger rating has been issued for the Greater Sydney, Illawarra/Shoalhaven and Southern Ranges areas, while all other areas are rated at high, very high or severe levels. 'Any fire that starts and takes hold will threaten lives and homes,' NSW RFS said. Pictured: Smoke from Gospers Mountain fire

At midday on Thursday, northwesterly winds will sweep the Gospers Mountain blaze in the path of the Green Wattle Creek fire at windspeeds of 40km/h. By 2pm - when the sweltering heat is expected to be at its worse - both fires will be pushed towards Sydney. Pictured: Gospers Mountain fire

Emergency Services Minister David Elliott said complacency is the biggest threat.

'Just because you haven't seen a fire at the end of your street, just because you can't see smoke in your suburb, doesn't mean that you are not at risk,' he told reporters.

There will be 3000 firefighters working on Saturday, the minister said.
