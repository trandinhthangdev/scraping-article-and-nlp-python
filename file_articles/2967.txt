Atletico Madrid are ready to make a move for Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic in January.

Diego Simeone would like to add the experienced midfielder to his squad for the second half of the season as they chase domestic and European silverware, according to Spanish outlet As.com.

Inter Milan are also interested in signing the 31-year-old, who has 18 months left on his contract and has fallen out of favour with United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

Matic has insisted he will 'always try to do his best' after he got a rare outing for Manchester United in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night.

The Serbian midfielder made just his seventh appearance of the season in the 3-0 win over Colchester United, starting in central midfield and playing the full 90 minutes.

'Of course, when I'm on the field I always try to do my best, I always try to help the team,' Matic told the official club website.

'When I'm on the pitch, I'm happy and I will continue to do my job.'
