In April, Joe wrote a column for Kidspot, in which he revealed that the prospect of having another daughter filled him with 'both great relief and great fear'.

'The relief is that I will not be headbutted in the nuts for the first 10 years of her life, and the fear is that for the second 10 I will have absolutely no idea what she is talking about,' the 42-year-old wrote.

He said: 'I have learned that it is simultaneously the hardest and the easiest thing in the world to do. There is nothing more impossible and nothing more natural.

'The terror of not knowing what you are going to do, or be able to do, or how to deal with a little baby, obviously that's gone the second time around.

'But you'll also have the even worse terror of knowing just what you're in for.'
