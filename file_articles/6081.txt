She's been tirelessly promoting her comeback single Lola for the last month.

And now Iggy Azalea is taking a much needed break with a Christmas holiday in Bali, Indonesia.

On Thursday, the 29-year-old took to Instagram to share a raunchy photo of herself posing in a skimpy bikini.

The former chart-topper's bikini top could barely contain her artificial assets, allowing for a generous amount of underboob to be on display.

She later went braless while posing for a sultry photo in a revealing denim dress with a plunging neckline.

For the last few weeks, Iggy has been promoting her single Lola, which features up and coming pop star Alice Chater.

Last week, the pair performed the track at the International Music Awards in Berlin.

Unfortunately, the song has yet to make an impact on the charts outside of New Zealand, where it peaked at No. 28.

The rapper was faced with more career struggles this month when she repeatedly delayed the release of her new album, Wicked Lips.

She claimed that the first delay was due to problems mixing one of the tracks on the project, and then cited mental health issues as the reason for a second delay.

She then lashed out at her fans on Twitter for complaining about the delays, claiming that they weren't respecting her mental health.

'I just don't f**k with "fans" who don't respect when people voice that they need a min to be mentally okay,' she raged.

'Y'all fake care about mental health until you are slightly inconvenienced by it, and that's the tea.'

The EP finally hit iTunes at the start of the month, but missed out on charting on the Billboard 200.
