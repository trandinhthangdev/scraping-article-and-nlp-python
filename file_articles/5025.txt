A Queensland water body implicated in a landmark 2011 floods class action case may appeal the decision.

Flood victims say it would be a "massive kick in the guts" while the Queensland ministers have called for no appeal to be made.

Almost 7000 flood victims won massive legal battle in the NSW Supreme Court last month when it ruled they were failed by engineers at Seqwater and Sunwater.

Engineers for the organisations negligently operated dams which led more damage there would have otherwise have been, the court found.

About 23,000 homes were hit by flood waters which inspired a clean up effort from volunteers known as the "Mud Army".

The decision opens the state government and both water entities up to a damages bill which could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

Sunwater says it will file a notice of intention to appeal the judgement in the NSW Supreme Court on Friday.

However the organisation says it is yet to commit to any appeal.

"No formal decision has been made to appeal, and Sunwater continues to carefully review the judgement and consider its options," it said in a statement.

Flood victim and former Ipswich Councillor Paul Tully said an appeal would be a "massive kick in the guts almost as bad as the flood itself".

An appeal means the case could drag on for a number of years yet.

"Seqwater and SunWater are toying with people's lives and futures," Mr Tully said.

The Queensland government has indicated it would not appeal the decision.

Deputy Premier Jackie Trad and Mines Minister Anthony Lynham have called on the water bodies not to appeal the decision.

They said they would not give the organisations a ministerial direction because it would not bind their insurers and could compromise their insurance policies.

Seqwater has also been contacted for comment.
