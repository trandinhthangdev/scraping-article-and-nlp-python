Getting a dog out of a tree is a call that many fictional firemen have had to tackle over the years - but became a real-life dilemma for one California station last week.

Sharon Thurston said she was walking her two-year-old German Shepherd Baby in a park in Sacramento on Saturday when she let go of her leash for a moment, before the canine took off in pursuit of a cat.

By the time Thurston managed to catch up with Baby, she was at the top of a tree on a precarious branch facing off with the feline - and unable to get back down.

With Thurston unable to climb up, she was left with little option but to call for help.

Firefighters were called to rescue the dog from the top of the tree after at first thinking the emergency call was a prank

Larry Madoski, who took the call, told CBS13: 'I took a chuckle and thought, "Well this is a first."

'I immediately placed a phone call to find out if somebody was kidding with me.'

After establishing that the call was not in fact a hoax, firefighters went down to the park and rescued Baby.

The cat, meanwhile, managed to climb down of her own accord.

Thankfully neither of the animals were hurt, and Thurston says Baby is now 'back to her old self'.
