Former boxer Andy Lee insists 'it's not too late' for Tyson Fury and Ben Davison to put their differences behind them.

The pair parted earlier this month ahead of Fury's huge heavyweight rematch with Deontay Wilder in February.

Lee insists he has 'no idea' why they split up and hopes that they can work together again.

Ex-boxer Andy Lee insists 'it's not too late' for Tyson Fury and Ben Davison to reunite

'I would like to see them reconcile and get back, it's not too late,' Lee said.

Speaking to the 5 Live Boxing Podcast, former world middleweight champion Lee added: 'I just feel it's unnecessary that they should be this strong-willed when the goal, to get the heavyweight championship of the world, is such a big purpose.

'I would like to see them get back together and if I can be a bridge for that, I will definitely be pushing it.'

Anthony Joshua backed Fury's decision to replace his trainer, arguing that a fighter has to 'follow his instinct'.

Fury enlisted the services of Javan 'Sugar' Hill ahead of his rematch with Wilder.

His move came in contrast to Joshua, who stuck with his coach Rob McCracken following his surprise defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr earlier this year and was vindicated when he won the rematch this month.
