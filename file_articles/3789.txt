THE HAGUE, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor said on Friday she will launch a full investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian Territories, which could include charges against Israelis or Palestinians.

"I am satisfied that ... war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip," Fatou Bensouda said in a statement.

Bensouda said that because the Palestinian Territories had requested the intervention of the court she did not need to request approval from judges to start an investigation. (Reporting by Stephanie van den Berg; Writing by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by David Clarke)
