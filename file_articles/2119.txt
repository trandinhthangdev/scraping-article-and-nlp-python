Forward Khadim Sy's career-high 20 points helped Ole Miss past pesky Southeastern Louisiana 83-76 in Jackson, Miss., on Saturday afternoon.

Guards Breein Tyree (14 points), guard Devontae Shuler (11) and forward Blake Hinson (10) added double-figure scoring for Ole Miss (8-3).

The Rebels survived a 30-point outburst by Southeast Louisiana forward Ty Brewer, a native of Meridian, Miss. -- about 90 miles from Jackson -- on 13-of-17 shooting.

Guard Laquan Butler added 12 points for the Lions (3-8), who shot 58.8 percent (10 of 17) from 3 but went 2-of-5 from the foul line.

Ole Miss expanded a one-point halftime lead when a Tyree 3 with 18:13 put the Rebels up six, tying their biggest advantage since an early 8-2 lead.

But the Lions didn't go away. Brewer cut to the hoop and fielded a pass for a lay-up, cutting the lead to 55-52 with 10:45 left.

The Rebels punched back to take their first double-figure lead with 6:37 left, but Butler's basket had SELA within three points with 2:51 left.

A 6-2 Rebels run on forward K.J. Buffen's putback, Tyree's two foul shots and then his jumper, made it 77-70 with just over a minute left, put the game away.

The first half was a jump-shooting exhibition headlined by Brewer, who had 17 points in the first 13 minutes.

The Lions took an early 15-11 lead in the first 5:12. A Southeaast Louisiana 3-pointer at 10:32 made it a six-point lead and Rebels coach Kermit Davis, displeased with the defense, took the team's second time out.

Ole Miss put Buffen on Brewer the final seven minutes of the half and held him scoreless the remainder of the period. The lead changed hands most of the rest of the half, with the Rebels leading 42-41 at the break.

Neither team attempted a free throw until Rebels forward Austin Crowley hit one with 5:53 left in the half.
