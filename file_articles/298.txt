A Victorian man has gone missing in North Queensland's crocodile-infested Daintree rainforest after bogging his ute, with police fearing for his safety.

Milan Lemic, 25, was last seen at Bairds Crossing near the Upper Daintree Village at about 4.30pm on Sunday, police say.

A member of the public offered to get a tractor to help free his car but when he returned 20 minutes later Mr Lemic had gone, Senior Sergeant Ed Lukin said on Monday.

"Enquires today have not been able to locate him (and) there are concerns for his safety."

"Obviously we can't discount the fact that there's some animal interaction that may have led to his disappearance," he said.

Emergency crews are searching the Daintree River.

An air and land search is also underway.

Mr Lemic is described as Caucasian and 191cm tall with black hair.

He was last seen wearing a bright fluro singlet, black gym shirt with white writing on it, black tracksuit pants, no shoes and no hat.
