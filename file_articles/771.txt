A man has been captured on CCTV allegedly breaking into a Queensland hostel and committing indecent acts towards a woman.

The man allegedly broke into a Sunshine Coast hostel about 4am on Sunday, where the 21-year-old Swiss woman woke to find him performing an indecent act.

On Monday afternoon a Queensland Police spokesman said officers had arrested a 41-year-old man at Golden Beach and he is assisting with inquiries.

'Police will allege that a male offender has entered the room and has gone up to a young sleeping backpacker here and has committed an indecent sex act,' the spokesman told 7 News.

'That young female has woken in the course of that and has feigned sleep.

'Police will allege the male offender has then attempted to get into bed with that young woman and it is at that stage that the female has yelled out.'

The woman yelled at him and he fled the hostel, on Omrah Avenue in the beachside area of Caloundra, in an unknown direction.

The spokesman confirmed the alleged victim was visiting from Switzerland and had been 'traumatised' by the alleged incident.

'As you can imagine she was incredibly traumatised by it,' the spokesman said.

'Having someone break into your room or your house at that hour in the morning is probably traumatic enough but to wake and see someone engaged in that sort of activity, she had a great level of fear.'
