She dropped the first single, the rock-infused anthem Nightmare, and its accompanied video, in May.

The hard-hitting tune, full of youth angst and rebellion, debuted in the top fifteen in the US.

It features guest appearances by Alanis Morissette, Dominic Fike and Suga of BTS.

Halsey recently revealed the South Korean boy band gifted her a sparkly microphone following their Boy With Luv collaboration.

'They gifted me my own sparkly mic,' gushed the singer on her YouTube channel.

'It was really thoughtful and really amazing and I got to use it.'

Earlier this year, Halsey released a remix of her single Without Me featuring JUICE WRLD, who passed away on Dec. 8.

Her sighting comes a week after she performed the song as a tribute to the late emo rapper at a concert in Brooklyn.

She told the crowd: 'The remix of this song is the better version of this song, and I think everybody knows that deep down inside. But I really want to play it tonight for him.'

Halsey is currently dating actor Evan Peters.
