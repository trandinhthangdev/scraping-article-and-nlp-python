Arizona hired former Iowa State head coach and UCLA assistant Paul Rhoads as its defensive coordinator Friday.

"I can't begin to express how excited and grateful I am to have the opportunity to work alongside Coach Sumlin and the rest of the Arizona Football Family," Rhoads said in a release.

Rhoads is replacing Marcel Yates, who was fired by Sumlin in October after the Wildcats allowed 41 or more points in three consecutive games.

"Paul is a man of personal and professional integrity," Sumlin said in the release. "He brings to Arizona a history of proven success as a leader and teacher who will bring a focus on relationships, communication and fundamentals. I look forward to working with Paul as we continue to position our program for future success."

Rhoads, 52, was Iowa State's coach from 2009-15, and compiled a 32-55 record, leading the Cyclones to three bowl games, including a win in the 2009 Insight Bowl.

He was the defensive backs coach at UCLA the past two seasons, with the team allowing 34.4 points over that time, and over a two-year period (2016-17) was defensive backs coach, defensive coordinator, then interim head coach at Arkansas.

Rhoads was also defensive coordinator at Pitt (2000-07) and Auburn (2008).
