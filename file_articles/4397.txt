Glenn Hoddle believes Tottenham are a bigger club than Chelsea.

And he thinks that new manager Jose Mourinho may have underestimated the size of the club he has taken over after replacing Mauricio Pochettino last month.

The former England coach believes Spurs have a larger fanbase and bigger and better training facilities than their rivals in west London.

'If Mourinho does win silverware at Tottenham it will prove to have been the right move at the right time for him to go to Spurs', he wrote in a foreword to the book The Boss — Memories of Bill Nicholson to Jose, published this week and serialised by The Sun.

'It will also turn out to be a shrewd move for Mourinho, who will quickly discover that Spurs are a massive club — much bigger than he might have thought.

'He has probably underestimated just how big a club Spurs are.

'There is a bigger fanbase than at Chelsea and no one now has better facilities in terms of training ground and stadium.

'He has walked into a fantastic job at the right time with Spurs becoming a modern-day club. This is a good marriage.'

Tottenham host Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday and can leapfrog their bitter London rivals into fourth place with victory.

Spurs have won four of their last five league games since Mourinho took over to charge up the table.
