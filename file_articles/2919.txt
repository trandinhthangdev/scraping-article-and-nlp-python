Charges against a man accused of starting a fatal fire at a backpacker hostel in Perth have been upgraded to murder.

The 39-year-old man, who was a resident at the hostel, has also been charged with five counts of acts causing danger in relation to the five people taken to hospital with smoke inhalation along with the original offence of criminal damage.

The fire at the hostel earlier this month killed a 44-year-old woman.

The man will appear next in Perth Magistrates Court on February 26.
