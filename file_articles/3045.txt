Arizona Coyotes goaltender Darcy Kuemper will be sidelined week-to-week due to an unspecified lower-body injury, the team said Friday.

Kuemper was injured during the third period of Thursday's 8-5 loss to the Minnesota Wild.

The 29-year-old Kuemper made a save with his right pad and fell to the ice. He was unable to get up and was eventually helped off the ice.

Kuemper has been enjoying a superb season for Arizona. He ranks fourth in the NHL with a 2.17 goals-against average and has a 15-8-2 record in 25 games.

Antti Raanta will fill in as the No. 1 goalie in Kuemper's absence. Raanta, 30, is 5-5-2 with a 2.72 GAA in 13 appearances this season.

Arizona also recalled goaltender Adin Hill from Tucson of the American Hockey League.

Hill, 23, was 7-5-0 with a 2.76 goals-against average in 13 games with the Coyotes last season. He hasn't played in any games for Arizona this season.
