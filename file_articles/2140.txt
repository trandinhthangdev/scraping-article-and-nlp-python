Center Lias Andersson, the No. 7 pick in the 2017 NHL Draft, has asked the New York Rangers to trade him, according to multiple reports Saturday.

The 21-year-old was on the Opening Day roster and played 17 games in New York before being demoted to Hartford of the American Hockey League. He averaged 9:33 of ice time while playing on the fourth line.

Andersson had one assist with the Rangers, then tallied five points (four goals, one assist) in Hartford.

General manager Jeff Gorton is expected to shop Andersson over the next week.

In 66 career NHL games, Andersson has nine points (three goals, six assists).
