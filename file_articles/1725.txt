More than 3000 properties in the Adelaide Hills remain without power as a result of the devastating bushfire that swept through the region and continues to burn.

SA Power Networks says crews are working in a number of areas to restore electricity supply.

But it says the timeframe to have all power restored is unclear, and in some cases it could take several days depending on access and the extent of the damage.

The company said it had already identified a number of spots where trees had fallen on powerlines.

"Anyone in fire-damaged areas is urged to keep clear of power poles and wires as there may still be some that haven't been inspected," it said.

Among those without electricity are properties in Woodside, Lenswood, Mt Torrens, Charleston and Lobethal.

The Adelaide Hills fire has so far burnt out more than 25,000 hectares inside a 127-kilometre perimeter.

A watch and act warning remains in place for the blaze which has destroyed at least 15 homes.
