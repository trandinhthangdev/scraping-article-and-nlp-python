A British Airways passenger has told police she spotted a drone flying at 30,000ft as her plane came into land at Heathrow.

Sarah Baker from Cambridge was on a flight from Tokyo when she saw the device 30 minutes before she landed in London.

Ms Baker said she could clearly see the drone had four legs and was partly blue as it hovered in UK airspace, in her police report according to The Mirror.

British law restricts the maximum height of drones to 400ft which must not be no more than 1640ft from the owner horizontally and always kept in sight.

Ms Baker said: 'I’m absolutely certain of what I saw. It was worrying.'

She contacted the Civil Aviation Authority who told her to contact the police.

However the Metropolitan Police said it had 'received contact' but was not investigating the drone sighting on November 29.

In June 2018 an Airbus A321 had just taken off and was climbing at 380mph when the drone suddenly came into view at 15,500ft – nearly 40 times the legal maximum.

The report concluded that the device, spotted near Doncaster Sheffield Airport in South Yorkshire, was so high it would have been impossible for its operator to see.

The incident happened at the highest ever altitude recorded for a near-miss between a drone and an aircraft in UK airspace
