A Muslim Uber driver refused to drive an elderly couple home from their local RSL because they were carrying a Christmas ham they had just won.

Marion Archibald, 66, and her husband Peter, 76, booked an Uber to take them home after winning a ham in a raffle at the Seaford RSL, in Melbourne's south, on Tuesday night.

But when the driver arrived and saw the couple was holding the large ham, he refused to take them home due to his religious beliefs.

Despite not being taken home by the Uber driver, Mr and Mrs Archibold were still charged their $10 fare.

'(The driver said) Oh no, what's that … he said he was Muslim. He said we couldn't get in … I thought he was kidding,' Mrs Archibold told The Leader.

The grandparents were left at the RSL at around 10pm, before a committee member offered to drive them home.

'He shouldn't have left us there … he could have at least called someone else for us,' she said.

'There will be plenty of people carrying hams in Uber rides this Christmas. We've all got different beliefs but this is ridiculous.'

Mrs Archibald said her complaints to Uber customer service were ignored, and she still hasn't been refunded the cost of the fare.

The couple said the experience left a bad taste in their mouths, and won't be using Uber in the future.

An Uber spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the charge that the customers had was a cancellation fee, the fee had since been refunded.
