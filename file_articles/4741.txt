Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk could miss the Club World Cup final against Flamengo on Saturday.

The Dutchman did some fitness work on Thursday but was still not able to complete a full training session, according to the Daily Mirror.

Van Dijk has been struggling with illness and sat out the 2-1 semi-final victory over Monterrey on Tuesday.

Liverpool face Flamengo in the final on Saturday and Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is unlikely to take a gamble on Van Dijk.

His absence meant Jordan Henderson took Van Dijk's position on the left hand side and with James Milner slotting in at right-back, given that Trent Alexander-Arnold was due a break.

Asked about the defender's absence, Klopp told liverpoolfc.com: 'It was an easy decision actually because he couldn't train.

'Yes, he was yesterday on the [training] pitch for a couple of minutes until the media left [the session] and then, unfortunately, he had to leave as well.

'Not because of the media, just because he didn't feel well. So yesterday [Tuesday] no training was possible, this morning [Wednesday] no training possible, so it was an easy decision – he couldn't play.

'It was difficult for Hendo to deal with, but he did really good. We will see, I don't know how quick he can recover. We will see.'

Liverpool are short of options as Joel Matip has not recovered from a long-standing knee issue, while Dejan Lovren is out until the New Year. Midfielder Fabinho, who can also play at the back, is also out with an ankle issue.
