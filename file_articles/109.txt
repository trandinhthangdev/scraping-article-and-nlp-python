South Africa seamer Vernon Philander has announced his international retirement at the conclusion of the forthcoming series against England.

The 34-year-old has played 60 Tests and 37 white-ball games for the Proteas and has chosen to walk away in the new year.

He has taken 216 Test scalps, at a superb average of 22.16, as well as 41 in one-day internationals and four during a brief stint in Twenty20s.

Arguably his most memorable moment came on Test debut in 2011 when he claimed five for 15 in the second innings against Australia, helping to bowl the tourists out for 47 in Cape Town.

'I want to give thanks to my Heavenly Father for blessing me with the opportunity to represent my country for the last 12 years,' he said.

'It has been a honour and privilege to have played alongside the very best in the game. Thank you must also go to Cricket South Africa, the Cobras, all the coaches, management, captains and team-mates and the very special fans from all over the world for your love and support.

'My entire focus and energy at this time is to help the Proteas beat England which I am really looking forward to.'

Graeme Smith, CSA's newly-appointed director of cricket and Philander's long-time captain, paid tribute to the paceman.

'One of the many things that have stood out for me with Vern is his character, his determination and the way that he has always been up for a fight and a challenge has shown the heart of the man,' he said.

'He has really done himself and his family proud and I hope he can finish his final series for South Africa with the same character and flair that has become synonymous with him.'
