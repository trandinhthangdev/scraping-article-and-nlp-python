Luke Shaw believes Manchester United team-mate David de Gea will bounce back from his blunder during the Premier League defeat by Watford.

The Spain international goalkeeper was left prostrate with his head in his hands after he fumbled Ismaila Sarr's effort into the net on 50 minutes.

The ball bounced off the turf and slipped through de Gea's fingers, rebounding off the post, back onto his head, and into the net.

And the Red Devils never fully recovered from that moment. The Hornets doubled their lead just four minutes later when Troy Deeney scored from the penalty spot after Aaron Wan-Bissaka fouled Sarr.

But left-back Shaw, who made just his fifth league start of the campaign at Vicarage Road, expects de Gea to return to form when the Red Devils host Newcastle on Boxing Day.

'Of course, it was a freak goal,' Shaw told Manchester United's club website.

'David has saved us so many times in so many different matches over the years he has been here. There is no way you can point any blame at him at all.

'He is a world-class goalkeeper and I am sure he will pick himself up.

'I am sure all of the lads will be around him. David is David. He is always happy so hopefully he can stay happy and focus on the game on Boxing Day.'
